Model-Driven Digital Twin Construction: Synthesizing the Integration of Cyber-Physical Systems with Their Information Systems;Digital twins emerge in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-physical systems, such as airplanes, cars, factories, medical devices, or ships. There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;Kirchhof JC,Michael J,Rumpe B,Varga S,Wortmann A;2020;Conference Paper;ACM
Measuring the Fidelity of Digital Twin Systems;A digital twin is a virtual replica of a system at a certain level of fidelity, synchronized at a specific frequency. Digital twins often replicate physical systems whose simulations are usually computationally costly. One of the solutions to this problem proposed in the literature is to define a hierarchy of multi-fidelity digital twins, where we use one twin or another depending on the specific purpose. However, one of the challenges of this proposal is the need to determine whether the different twins are equivalent to each other and the physical system. In this thesis, we explore different methods to measure this equivalence by analyzing the state and behavior of the twins with the aid of high-level software models.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Muñoz P;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Digital Twin as Risk-Free Experimentation Aid for Techno-Socio-Economic Systems;Environmental uncertainties and hyperconnectivity force technosocio-economic systems to introspect and adapt to succeed and survive. Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling & Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss the rigor of our validation of the proposed approach and associated technology infrastructure through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;Barat S,Kulkarni V,Clark T,Barn B;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Using Trace Alignments for Measuring the Similarity between a Physical and Its Digital Twin;A common problem in the development of digital twin systems is the validation that the behavior of both twins, the physical and the digital, is the same, or at least similar enough given the requirements of the digital twin system. In this paper, we propose a method for the alignment of the traces of both twins. Traces are sequences of snapshots that capture the progressive states of each entity. Our approach is based on a bioinformatic algorithm that we adapt and use for the alignment of snapshots. Additionally, we include a set of measures to evaluate the quality of these alignments and reason about the level of fidelity of the digital twin system. Two case studies are used to demonstrate our proposal and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Muñoz P,Wimmer M,Troya J,Vallecillo A;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Towards a Digital Twin for Cyber-Physical Production Systems: A Multi-Paradigm Modeling Approach in the Postal Industry;This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Niati A,Selma C,Tamzalit D,Bruneliere H,Mebarki N,Cardin O;2020;Conference Paper;ACM
A Novel Methodology to Construct Digital Twin Models for Spacecraft Operations Using Fault and Behaviour Trees;Successful satellite data reception requires the nominal operation of the ground stations in charge of their health monitoring as much as the spacecrafts themselves. Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Christofi N,Pucel X;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Understanding and Improving Model-Driven IoT Systems through Accompanying Digital Twins;Developers questioning why their system behaves differently than expected often have to rely on time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis of log files. Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system’s executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system’s environment based on the data recorded by the system’s digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study. By facilitating the reproduction of the system’s behavior, our method lowers the barrier to understanding the behavior of model-driven IoT systems.;Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences;Kirchhof JC,Malcher L,Rumpe B;2021;Conference Paper;ACM
CPSAML: A Language and Code Generation Framework for Digital Twin Based Monitoring of Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems;Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are finding increasing use, whether in factories, autonomous vehicles, or smart buildings. Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Fend A,Bork D;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
On the Engineering of IoT-Intensive Digital Twin Software Systems;Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.;Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops;Rivera LF,Müller HA,Villegas NM,Tamura G,Jiménez M;2020;Conference Paper;ACM
A Flexible and Modular Architecture for Edge Digital Twin: Implementation and Evaluation;IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.;ACM Trans.

Enabling Semantic Interoperability of Asset Administration Shells through an Ontology-Based Modeling Method;Digital twin technology establishes the future development vision for Industry 4.0, and is also an important exploration direction for the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm. Because it builds a more flexible and communicative production system through models that spans life cycle, hierarchy and architecture. The standard proposed under the concept of Industry 4.0, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), provides a syntactic interoperability interface for all assets involved in smart factories. However, there is still a need to fill the gap regarding semantic interoperability, in order to allow efficient interactions between Industry 4.0 components. Ontologies are a good candidate because they provide formal semantics expressed using a knowledge representation language, and in addition, there are many associated mature tools for reasoning and inference. Therefore, we propose a modeling approach that provides semantic interoperability for AAS-based digital twins using ontologies.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Huang Y,Dhouib S,Medinacelli LP,Malenfant J;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Challenges and Possible Approaches for Sustainable Digital Twinning;The advance in digital twin technology is creating value for lots of companies. We look at the digital twin design and operation from a sustainability perspective. We identify some challenges related to a digital twin's sustainable design and operation. Finally, we look at some possible approaches, grounded in multi-paradigm modelling to help us create and deploy more sustainable twins.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Bellis S,Denil J;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Coordination and Explanation of Reconfigurations in Self-Adaptive High-Performance Systems;Self-adaptive systems that modify their architecture to achieve different Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are becoming well-established parts of a company's portfolio. Current systems however do a poor job of coordinating the underlying rules and explaining the system's behavior to developers. This negatively impacts a system's performance due to behaving in unintended and hard-to-comprehend ways.In this vision paper, we introduce an approach that intends to alleviate these problems, for the use-case of high-performance cloud clusters, through the use of a cyber-cyber digital twin based on the Palladio ecosystem. The conceived digital twin allows for several functions that are unexplored in literature so far: the combination of design time analysis with explainability, use of state-space prediction bounded by likelihood, and explanation of non-applicability. This is achieved through a digital twin performing three main activities:1) The predicting activity predicts system performance along several potential paths.2) The planning activity analyzes reconfiguration rules and predicted system behavior to produce reconfiguration plans that try to optimally utilize available resources and achieve all SLOs without unintended interactions between the execution of rules.3) The explaining activity processes all artifacts produced during system simulation time or runtime to provide comprehensive visualizations to developers.We explain how each activity is performed and what models it processes and produces based on a running example.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Stieß S,Becker S,Ege F,Höppner S,Tichy M;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Case Study on Automated and Continuous Reliability Assessment of Software-Defined Manufacturing Based on Digital Twins;Traditional production systems are characterized by rare software updates and fixed production lines. Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-to-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology.In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework.;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Grimmeisen P,Wortmann A,Morozov A;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Integration of SysML Models in a 3D Environment for Virtual Testing and Validation;Model–Driven Systems Engineering has been presented as a promising approach for developing complex systems. To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system’s development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.;Proceedings of the Federated Africa and Middle East Conference on Software Engineering;Barosan I,van der Heijden J;2022;Conference Paper;ACM
Semantic digital twins for organizational development;Semantic-based Digital Twins can be applied to the enactment of the digital counterparts of enterprises and organizations, and not only for physical devices or machines.

This work condenses our experience in the creation of Digital Twins for Organizations, using model-driven engineering based on semantic modeling. We will describe their more relevant characterizations and discuss their potential impact in their business implementations.

"A pattern catalog for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavior; [Ein Musterkatalog zur Erweiterung von digitalen Zwillingsmodellen um Verhaltenssichten]";Digital Twins are emerging as a solution to build and extend existing software systems to make better use of data produced by physical systems. For supporting the development of Digital Twins, several software vendors are offering dedicated tool support, often referred to as Digital Twin platforms. The modeling capabilities of these platforms are mostly concerned with structural viewpoints, i.e., providing an overview of available components including their current and historical sensor values. However, behavioral viewpoints did not yet receive much attention on these platforms. As behavioral models are often used during the design processes, e.g., for simulation and synthesis, it would be beneficial for having them included in Digital Twin platforms, e.g., for reasoning on the set of possible next actions or for checking the execution history to perform runtime validation. In this paper, we present a catalog of modeling patterns for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavioral models and their corresponding runtime information without requiring any extension of the code bases of Digital Twin platforms. We demonstrate the presented modeling patterns by applying them to the Digital Twin platform offered by Microsoft, in an additive manufacturing use case of a 3D printer in a production line. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.;At-Automatisierungstechnik;"Lehner D.; Sint S.; Eisenberg M.; Wimmer M.";2023;Article;De Gruyter Oldenbourg
Ensuring consistency in scalable-detail models for DT-based control;Digital Twins (DTs for short) are a powerful aid for creating, assessing and maintaining control strategies. This use of DTs however requires that the physical entities to control be described at different levels of detail. For example, simple I/O models are used to compute parameters of modulating controllers, more time-accurate ones may be required to set up and assess logic controls, high-accuracy, possibly nonlinear ones may serve for overall strategy verification, and for software-in-the-loop testing, also the host computing/network architecture needs representing. In such a complex scenario, guaranteeing that all the descriptions of all elements are consistent with one another is a relevant problem. We discuss this matter and propose a solution, in the form of a modelling paradigm where - as a novel contributions - relationships (in a sense analogous to what the term means in database theory) can be instated and enforced. This allows to create and maintain knowledge based made of interrelate data and models, embracing all the major DT interpretations proposed so far in the literature, or said more explicitly, combining data-driven and model-driven DTs in a single framework. We also provide an illustrative example. © 2021 The Authors.

The OMiLAB Digital Innovation environment: Agile conceptual models to bridge business value with Digital and Physical Twins for Product-Service Systems development;OMiLAB is a community of practice which offers a digital ecosystem bringing together open technologies to investigate and apply conceptual modeling methods for varying purposes and domains. One of the core value propositions is a dedicated Digital Innovation environment comprising several toolkits and workspaces, designed to support Product-Service Systems (PSS) prototyping – a key ingredient for PSS lifecycle management. At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin – a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles. It addresses the problem of historically-disconnected skills required for Digital Innovation projects and it provides a testbed for feasibility experimentation. For design-oriented, artifact building research, a higher Technology Readiness Level can thus be achieved (compared to the level that idea development methods typically attain). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.;Computers in Industry;"Karagiannis D.; Buchmann R.A.; Utz W.";2022;Article;Elsevier B.V.
Digital twin enhanced human-machine interaction in product lifecycle;Human-machine interaction (HMI) is a key technology for implementing smart manufacturing, which primarily focuses on the issues of communication, interaction, and cooperation between humans and machines. HMI has been widely studied in product lifecycle including product design, manufacturing, and service, but the efficiency and safety still cannot meet the new requirements for smart manufacturing along with new emerging technologies (e.g., big data, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, etc.). Digital twin (DT), as a new technology to realize cyber-physical integration, provides a new chance to address the above problems. Using a five-dimension DT model driven by real-time data, HMI will generate a more flexible interactive mode to improve machine efficiency and operation safety. In this paper, HMI in product lifecycle is investigated first, and the shortness and new requirements are analyzed, then a DT enhanced HMI framework is proposed to address the shortness. © 2019 The Authors.

Modular Fault Ascription and Corrective Maintenance Using a Digital Twin;The industrial environment is slowly transforming to a networked system of systems nature with industry 4.0. Automation systems are getting more production friendly by being more reconfigurable and adaptable. The plant engineering process is also getting improved by offering modular architecture, model-based engineering, etc. This transformation necessitates novel methodologies in maintenance practices as well. With the emergence of predictive maintenance techniques, sometimes it is possible to predict a breakdown and thus conveniently schedule the corrective maintenance. But this is not always the case, the incidence of unscheduled corrective maintenance is prevalent in an industrial environment. And the methodologies for corrective maintenance have to be reshaped fitting to the new plant environment. This paper introduces a new modular corrective maintenance methodology, using the digital twin of an automation module. Fault ascription support for a human technician, performing corrective maintenance action of an automation module is provided by its digital twin and associated visual interface. A use case scenario is propounded and future visions are presented. © 2018;;"Vathoopan M.; Johny M.; Zoitl A.; Knoll A.";2018;Conference paper;Elsevier B.V.
Generating customized low-code development platforms for digital twins;A digital twin improves our use of a cyber–physical system and understanding of its emerging behavior. To this effect, a digital twin is to be developed and configured and potentially also operated by domain experts, who rarely have a professional software engineering background and for whom easy access and support, e.g., in form of low-code platforms are missing. In this paper, we report on an integrated method for the model-driven engineering of low-code development platforms for digital twins that enables domain experts to create and operate digital twins for cyber–physical systems using the most appropriate modeling languages. The foundation of this method is (1) a code generation infrastructure for information systems combined with (2) an extensible base architecture for self-adaptive digital twins and (3) reusable language components for their configuration. Using this method, software engineers first configure the information system with the required modeling languages to generate the low-code development platform for digital twins before domain experts leverage the generated platform to create digital twins. This two-step method facilitates creating tailored low-code development platforms as well as creating and operating customized digital twins for a variety of applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Journal of Computer Languages;"Dalibor M.; Heithoff M.; Michael J.; Netz L.; Pfeiffer J.; Rumpe B.; Varga S.; Wortmann A.";2022;Article;Elsevier Ltd
A data-model fusion dispatch strategy for the building energy flexibility based on the digital twin;With the growing percentage of the intermittent renewable power generation, the energy system is under increasing pressure in balancing the supply and the demand. As a major part of urban energy consumptions, buildings can provide considerable regulation flexibility for the energy system by actively managing their energy demands. For the building energy flexibility (BEF) provided by thermostatically controlled loads (TCL), its dispatch performance is vulnerable to the building thermal parameter errors, and in some cases, occupants need to provide the critical information related to the indoor temperature state and the occupancy state to the energy management system outside buildings, which decreases the availability of the BEF and raises privacy concerns. For these issues in the BEF utilization, this paper proposes a data-model fusion dispatch strategy based on the digital twin (DT). The proposed strategy is capable of parameter fault tolerance and privacy protection by combining the model-free advantage of the data-driven method with the analytical optimization advantage of the model-driven method. Firstly, a DT-based BEF dispatch framework is proposed. Secondly, the building DT is established by combining the building thermal dynamics (BTD) data-driven model and the TCL operation mechanism model. And the building response deduction is carried out based on the DT. Finally, under the rolling optimization framework, the data-model fusion dispatch strategy is devised by uniting the DT deduction and the optimization constructed by the BTD mechanism model, in which the multi-dimensional modeling of the BTD is carried out from the state dimension and the energy dimension. The simulation results show that the optimization result can reach 98.4% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% parameter random error, and 98.3% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% random state noise injection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Applied Energy;"Song Y.; Xia M.; Chen Q.; Chen F.";2023;Article;Elsevier Ltd
Meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin architecture, modeling and application;Digital twin is regarded as the virtual counterpart of physical entities, which can mirror the physical behavior and performance. Digital twin technology provides strong support for the achievement of cyber-physical system and intelligent manufacturing. Many investigations have been carried out for the digital twin of specific products. However, there are less researches on digital twin in the shop-floor domain, and there is a lack of model-driven digital twin comprehensive architecture. The modeling approach to the full lifecycle of digital twin is not considered enough. This paper proposes a meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin construction approach and a comprehensive architecture. A meta-model based on RAMI 4.0 is constructed, which provide a novel idea for the description of manufacturing resources and their status. The proposed shop-floor digital twin architecture consists of three key implementation elements: the meta-model construction, data modeling (including data interaction between cyber-physical spaces) and constructing different integration level models of shop-floor digital twin based on iteration feedback between the demands and models. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of the fischer learning factory 4.0. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;"Yang X.; Liu X.; Zhang H.; Fu L.; Yu Y.";2023;Article;Elsevier Ltd
3D crowdsourced parametric cadastral mapping: Pathways integrating BIM/IFC, crowdsourced data and LADM;"This paper is part of a doctoral dissertation (PhD) research aligned with global trends aiming to develop practical technical tools for the collection, management and visualization of three-dimensional (3D) property rights in urban areas. Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs – those available – to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., orthophotos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data – if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy – in the absence of BIM – are discussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better visual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures. © 2023";Land Use Policy;"Gkeli M.; Potsiou C.";2023;Article;Elsevier Ltd
Generating Digital Twin Cockpits for Parameter Management in the Engineering of Wind Turbines;The complexity of wind energy systems combined with an increased trend towards mass customization require the collaboration of many experts to achieve high quality products. Currently, a major issue arises from the lack of data integration among the different tools used during the engineering process which may cause system failures eventually. Existing tools largely do not support automatic detection and indication of erroneous or contradictory parameter values between artifacts of different tools. Employing a model-driven and functional engineering approach enables to establish an integrated toolchain for the management and visualization of engineering artifacts that consume and produce the data. Within this paper, we present an automatic approach to derive an engineering digital twin for the cooperative development and management of engineering artifacts from functional models of the system under development. We evaluate our approach on the example of a hydraulic pump within the cooling system of a wind turbine. The prototype can be coupled with an existing engineering tool ecosystem. The approach enables to exchange the data produced by engineering artifacts according to a functional system model which facilitates the cooperation between different stakeholders throughout the development process. © Gesellschaft für Informatik, Bonn 2022.;Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI), Proceedings - Series of the Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI);"Michael J.; Nachmann I.; Netz L.; Rumpe B.; Stüber S.";2022;Conference paper;Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI)
Digital Twin Enables Rational Design of Ultrahigh-Power Lithium-Ion Batteries;With the widespread applications of electric vehicles, power grid stabilization, and high-pulsed power loads, high-power lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are in urgent demand. However, the existing experimental-based design of high-power batteries is usually costly and inefficient, and provides limited information on the complex physicochemical processes inside the batteries. Digital twin concept is promising for capturing the batteries’ electrochemical performance, and optimizing the power capability of LIBs. Here, an electrochemical-thermal coupled model is developed as a digital twin model for rational design of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite LIBs. The model can accurately predict the batteries’ performance and help to predetermine the optimal parameters to achieve an ultrahigh power capability. After model-guided optimization, the battery shows a high energy density of 92.38 Wh kg−1 at an ultrafast discharging current of 50 C and can withstand 150 C pulse discharging tests. Notably, the digital twin model can reveal experimentally inaccessible time- and space-resolved information and identify the rate-determining steps inside the battery. Hence, model-driven optimization of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite batteries is successfully realized aiming at the critical factors in the rate-determining steps. The work provides an instructive design of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite batteries, which might guide the future direction to boost the power capability of LIBs. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.;Advanced Energy Materials;"Zhang H.; Ren D.; Ming H.; Zhang W.; Cao G.; Liu J.; Wang L.; Song J.; Qiu J.; Wang J.; He X.; Zhang H.";2023;Article;John Wiley and Sons Inc
A framework for Model-Driven Engineering of resilient software-controlled systems;Emergent paradigms of Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things expect cyber-physical systems to reliably provide services overcoming disruptions in operative conditions and adapting to changes in architectural and functional requirements. In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, a reflective architecture developed around digital twins enables representation and control of system Configuration Items properly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones. © 2020, The Author(s).;Computing;"Parri J.; Patara F.; Sampietro S.; Vicario E.";2021;Article;Springer
Model-Driven Development of a Digital Twin for Injection Molding;Digital Twins (DTs) of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) enable the smart automation of production processes, collection of data, and can thus reduce manual efforts for supervising and controlling CPPSs. Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);"Bibow P.; Dalibor M.; Hopmann C.; Mainz B.; Rumpe B.; Schmalzing D.; Schmitz M.; Wortmann A.";2020;Conference paper;Springer
The Framework for Designing Autonomous Cyber-Physical Multi-agent Systems for Adaptive Resource Management;The paper contributes to design of autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management providing increase of efficiency of business operating in uncertain and dynamic environment. Evolution of multi-agent systems from purely decision-making support and simulation tool to cyber-physical system including Digital Twins and fully autonomous systems is analyzed. The main paper contribution is the proposed conceptual framework for designing autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management. It is shown in the paper that, in cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management, the ontology-customized multi-agent engine and ontology-based model of enterprise are forming ontology-driven “Digital Twin” of the enterprise providing opportunity to combine operational scheduling of resources with ongoing real-time simulations and evolutional re-design of configuration of enterprise resources. The functionality and architecture of the autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are developed to support for the full cycle of autonomous decision making on resource management. Time metrics for measuring event-based response time and level of adaptability of autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are proposed. Results of developments can be applied for smart transport and smart manufacturing, smart agriculture, smart logistics, smart supply chains, etc. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);"Gorodetsky V.I.; Kozhevnikov S.S.; Novichkov D.; Skobelev P.O.";2019;Conference paper;Springer
A Digital Twin Model-Driven Architecture for Cyber-Physical and Human Systems;The cyber-physical and human system (CPHS) is widely recognized as a key infrastructure to support the future developments in healthcare, industrial manufacturing as well as in many other areas. In consequence, there is an increasing interest in tools, techniques, and technologies to advance the understanding and provide unchallenging improvement of CPHS. Digital Twin is a growing research topic that can equip the CPHS with high-fidelity mirroring, monitoring, controlling, and active functional improvement. The central question in this study asks in what way Digital Twin should be designed and developed for a CPHS. An architecture was required to answer this question and build upon model to define guidelines and requirements for valid Digital Twin. Thus, this study provides much new knowledge about the emerging role of Digital Twin in CPHS by using a model-driven architecture (MDA) approach with the perspective of SD logic. In addition, in the presence of human roles, the given MDA is beneficial for providing abstractions of Digital Twin from different viewpoints, communication with non-technical experts, and decision support, system design, and improvement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Proceedings of the I-ESA Conferences;"Poursoltan M.; Traore M.K.; Pinède N.; Vallespir B.";2023;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Model-driven engineering city spaces via bidirectional model transformations;"Engineering cyber-physical systems inhabiting contemporary urban spatial environments demands software engineering facilities to support design and operation. Tools and approaches in civil engineering and architectural informatics produce artifacts that are geometrical or geographical representations describing physical spaces. The models we consider conform to the CityGML standard; although relying on international standards and accessible in machine-readable formats, such physical space descriptions often lack semantic information that can be used to support analyses. In our context, analysis as commonly understood in software engineering refers to reasoning on properties of an abstracted model—in this case a city design. We support model-based development, firstly by providing a way to derive analyzable models from CityGML descriptions, and secondly, we ensure that changes performed are propagated correctly. Essentially, a digital twin of a city is kept synchronized, in both directions, with the information from the actual city. Specifically, our formal programming technique and accompanying technical framework assure that relevant information added, or changes applied to the domain (resp. analyzable) model are reflected back in the analyzable (resp. domain) model automatically and coherently. The technique developed is rooted in the theory of bidirectional transformations, which guarantees that synchronization between models is consistent and well behaved. Produced models can bootstrap graph-theoretic, spatial or dynamic analyses. We demonstrate that bidirectional transformations can be achieved in practice on real city models. © 2021, The Author(s).";Software and Systems Modeling;"Visconti E.; Tsigkanos C.; Hu Z.; Ghezzi C.";2021;Article;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
A New 5S Radar Structure Design Model Driven by Digital Twin;Digital Twin (DT) is acting as a key to realize Cyber-Physical System (CPS) supporting smart manufacturing. In radar community, ideal design description, poor dynamic interaction and limited implementation extension have significant impacts on effectiveness and efficiency of digital radar structure design. For addressing these shortfalls, a new 5S Radar Structure Design Model (5S-RSDM) driven by DT is proposed in this paper, whose composition, design optimization and design knowledge management are discussed. It shows that 5S-RSDM is helpful for persistent design optimization, efficient design knowledge management and significant radar SWaP decrease by creating a digital radar structure twin with dynamic interaction with the physical radar structure counterpart. © 2022, Science Press.;Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering;"Deng D.; Ding X.; Wang L.";2022;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Towards Reactive Planning with Digital Twins and Model-Driven Optimization;Digital Twins are emerging in several domains. They allow to connect various models with running systems based on bi-directional data exchange. Thus, design models can be extended with runtime views which also opens the door for many additional techniques such as identifying unexpected system changes during runtime. However, dedicated reactions to these unexpected changes, such as adapting an existing plan which has been computed in advance and may no longer be seen beneficial, are still often neglected in Digital Twins. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose so-called reactive planning that integrates Digital Twins with planning approaches to react to unforeseen changes during plan execution. In particular, we introduce an extended Digital Twin architecture which allows to integrate existing model-driven optimization frameworks. Based on this integration, we present different strategies how the replanning can be performed by utilizing the information and services available in Digital Twins. We evaluate our approach for a stack allocation case study. This evaluation yields promising results on how to effectively improve existing plans during runtime, but also allows to identify future lines of research in this area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);"Eisenberg M.; Lehner D.; Sindelar R.; Wimmer M.";2022;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Model-Driven Engineering in Digital Thread Platforms: A Practical Use Case and Future Challenges;The increasing complexity delivered by the heterogeneity of the cyber-physical systems is being addressed and decoded by edge technologies, IoT development, robotics, digital twin engineering, and AI. Nevertheless, tackling the orchestration of these complex ecosystems has become a challenging problem. Specially the inherent entanglement of the different emerging technologies makes it hard to maintain and scale such ecosystems. In this context, the usage of model-driven engineering as a more abstract form of glue-code, replacing the boilerplate fashion, has improved the software development lifecycle, democratising the access to and use of the aforementioned technologies. In this paper, we present a practical use case in the context of Smart Manufacturing, where we use several platforms as providers of a high-level abstraction layer, as well as security measures, allowing a more efficient system construction and interoperability. © 2022, The Author(s).;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);"Chaudhary H.A.A.; Guevara I.; John J.; Singh A.; Ghosal A.; Pesch D.; Margaria T.";2022;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Performance Evaluation: Model-Driven or Problem-Driven?;In this paper I address the divide that has emerged between the field of performance evaluation and the field of computer and communication system design. After looking back briefly on the history of the field, I subsequently reflect on the reasons why the field of performance evaluation has become so isolated. I then continue with a set of eight recommendations, based on my experience in performing projects with industry, that will help in reconnecting, and that will result in a better uptake of the newest techniques and tools in the field of design of computer and communication systems. Following these recommendations will probably push scientists a little out of their comfort zone, however, I feel the potential extra reward of seeing our work truly applied is more than worth it. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Haverkort B.R.;2021;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Towards Development Platforms for Digital Twins: A Model-Driven Low-Code Approach;Digital Twins in smart manufacturing must be highly adaptable for different challenges, environments, and system states. In practice, there is a need for enabling the configuration of Digital Twins by domain experts. Low-code approaches seem to be a meaningful solution for configuration purposes but often lack extension options. We propose a model-driven low-code approach for the configuration and reconfiguration of Digital Twins using language plugins. This approach uses model-driven software engineering and software language engineering methods to derive a configurable digital twin implementation. Moreover, we discuss some remaining challenges such as interoperability, language modularity, evolution, integration of assistive services, collaborative development, and web-based debugging. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.;IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology;"Michael J.; Wortmann A.";2021;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Applying a Healthcare Web of Things Framework for Infertility Treatments;According to doctors and researchers, fertility problems are becoming epidemic proportions. Meanwhile, the demand for infertility treatment is increasing by 5–10% per year. To support the growing demand, physicians need to define personalized remote monitoring treatments supported by devices that send real-time information on hormones levels, heart-rate, temperature, etc. To this end, Healthcare Monitoring Systems (HMS) have recently appeared, based on increasingly advanced devices that help to manage this task. However, current solutions are expensive and not very customizable by physicians themselves. In this paper, we propose a framework called MoSTHealth, based on digital twins and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), allows healthcare experts to model a personalized Web of Things (WoT) HMS scenario per treatment and per patient. Thanks to MDE, the simulated scenario allows us to generate a Service-Oriented enterprise cloud architecture that integrates a prediction module based on machine learning and data analysis. In this paper, a WoT HMS scenario for infertility treatment is presented as a case study. In this scenario, a specific care plan is defined, associated with a set of devices, including the use of a biosensing device that sends hormones levels in real-time. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);"Gorelova A.; Meliá S.";2022;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH

We propose model-driven software engineering to realize interactive digital twins and user-specific cockpits to interact with the digital twin by generating the infrastructure from common data structure models. To this end, we present a model-driven architecture for digital twins, its integration with an interactive cockpit, and a systematic method of realizing both. Through this, modeling, deploying, and monitoring interactive digital twins becomes more feasible and fosters their successful application in smart manufacturing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);"Dalibor M.; Michael J.; Rumpe B.; Varga S.; Wortmann A.";2020;Conference paper;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH
Dynamic design method of digital twin process model driven by knowledge-evolution machining features;Machining plan is the core of guiding manufacturing production and is regarded as one of the keys to ensure the quality of product processing. Existing process design methods are inefficient to quickly handle the machining plan changed induced by the unpredictable events in real-time production. It inevitably causes time and economic losses for the enterprise. In order to express the evolutionary characteristics of product processing, the construction method of digital twin process model (DTPM) is proposed based on the knowledge-evolution machining features. Three key technologies include correlation structure of process knowledge, expression method of the evolution geometric features and the association mechanism between two are solved. On this basis, the construction framework of DTPM is illustrated. Then, the organisation and management mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous data is discussed in detail. At last, a case study of the complex machined part is researched, the results show that the processing time reduced by about 7% and the processing stability improved by 40%. Meanwhile, the implementation scheme, application process and effect of this case are described in detail to provide reference for enterprises. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;International Journal of Production Research;"Liu J.; Zhao P.; Jing X.; Cao X.; Sheng S.; Zhou H.; Liu X.; Feng F.";2022;Article;Taylor and Francis Ltd.

Generative and Model-driven SDK development for the Industrie 4.0 Digital Twin;Industrie 4.0 maps the digital twin as the Asset Administration Shell. To develop this digital twin, the Asset Administration Shell meta-model is used. A developer needs high-quality libraries in their programming languages to build the Asset Administration Shell in efficient and ergonomic way. The existing representations of the meta-model are inconvenient for moving from the specification to realizations in software development. This leads to many, often manual, re-implementations of the Asset Administration Shell in each programming language. We present an approach to automatically generate libraries based on the intermediate representation of the meta-model. The approach allows for practical and simple development process of Industrie 4.0 components, and scales across programming environments and future changes in the meta-model.;2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );"N.

Towards a Reference Architecture for Leveraging Model Repositories for Digital Twins;"In the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the degree of complexity continuously increases mainly due to new key-enabling technologies supporting those systems. One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS’s behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models"" are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case.";2020 25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);"D.

Data- and model-driven digital twins for design and logistics control of product distribution;Digital control of product-on-pallet distribution is organized on two layers in logistics systems: the low-level local process automation and the supervision and coordination dual logistic execution system. The paper's scientific contribution consists in a holonic control system for multiple robot palletizing cells for product-on-pallet distribution. In this holonic control approach, data-driven digital twins (DT) are created to optimize palletizing schedules, controlled with situation awareness and resource health monitoring. A model-driven DT configuration with embedded simulation faster than real-time is combined with the data-driven DT in a meta-level control scheme offering predictive situation awareness. The paper also presents a pure model-driven DT mock-up of a robot palletizing cell - simulation with software in the loop - in which the actual holonic control system including digital twins and decision making is used in the simulation as it will be deployed in reality.

A software engineering point of view on digital twin architecture;Digital twins, along with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, have been identified as one of the key technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the definition of Digital Twin (DT) is still abstract and context-dependent. In this paper, we present a metamodel that supports concrete and operational descriptions of digital twin deployment. This metamodel encompasses the different aspects of deployment, including the definition of hardware and software components that compose the layered cyber-physical architectures of the digital twin, along with the installation and instantiation tasks that compose deployment processes. Multiple configurations can also be defined to support the deployment of a digital twin in different execution contexts. The relevance of this metamodel was evaluated by two case studies. The first consists in deploying the digital twin of a cobot in a simulation environment. The second applies the approach in a home automation environment. In both cases, our metamodel provides complete and precise descriptions of the deployment process and thus constitutes a viable first step towards a model-driven approach for digital twin deployment.;2022 IEEE 27th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);"G.

AML4DT: A Model-Driven Framework for Developing and Maintaining Digital Twins with AutomationML;As technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming ubiquitous, systems adopting these technologies are getting increasingly complex. Digital Twins (DTs) provide comprehensive views on such systems, the data they generate during runtime, as well as their usage and evolution over time. Setting up the required infrastructure to run a Digital Twin is still an ambitious task that involves significant upfront efforts from domain experts, although existing knowledge about the systems, such as engineering models, may be already available for reuse. To address this issue, we present AML4DT, a model-driven framework supporting the development and maintenance of Digital Twin infrastructures by employing AutomationML (AML) models. We automatically establish a connection between systems and their DTs based on dedicated DT models. These DT models are automatically derived from existing AutomationML models, which are produced in the engineering phases of a system. Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases. A case study shows the benefits of developing and maintaining DTs based on AutomationML models using the proposed AML4DT framework.

Semantic Interoperability of Digital Twins: Ontology-based Capability Checking in AAS Modeling Framework;Industry 4.0 currently prepares a major shift towards extreme flexibility into production lines management. Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the “Papyrus for Manufacturing” toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning.

Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE): Integrating Experimentable Digital Twins with the Model-Driven Engineering Process;A particular problem in the practical application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for the development of complex products is the effective integration of other engineering models. The Model-Driven Engineering Process (MDEP) addresses this by providing clearly defined insert points for domain models and simulation engines. In Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE) Experimentable Digital Twins (EDTs) are integrated in the MDEP to realistically simulate how system functions would be executed by physical parts of the developed product. CLOSE thus can reduce the cycle times for analysis, design, development, optimisation, and some of the verification. This paper introduces the basic concept of CLOSE and illustrates its application with a case study.;2018 IEEE International Systems Engineering Symposium (ISSE);"M. D. Maio; G. -D. Kapos; N.

Improved Electric Vehicle Digital Twin Performance Incorporating Detailed Lithium-ion Battery Model;Electric Vehicle numbers have rapidly increased over the past decade. There is a dire need to establish accurate simulation frameworks to model the Electric Vehicle performance. Multiple simulation model-based approaches have been proposed in literature which consider the impact of various drive cycles on vehicle characteristics. All the available Electric Vehicle simulation models available in literature use lumped battery parameters which do not capture the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. A detailed battery model considering drive cycle dynamics In Electric Vehicle Digital Twins have not been explored by researchers. This paper aims to provide tangible EV performance characteristics accounting for detailed 2RC battery model. This paper has used a two wheeler drive characteristics driven by a 2 kW Brushless Direct Current Motor powered by a 3.2 kWh battery pack. This paper also compares the variations in battery parameters with the lumped battery model to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.;2022 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT);"A.

Workshop Management and Control System Based on Digital Twin;Aiming at the connotation and characteristics of digital twin, and improving the level of informatization and intelligence of the workshop, a workshop management and control system based on digital twins is proposed, which can realize the management and control of the full life cycle of digital twins. Based on the physical production line model of the digital twin, the virtual and real joint debugging method of the digital twin workshop is constructed: the controller controls the virtual model, and the virtual model drives the simulation. The operation and control model of the digital twin is driven through the communication framework of OPC UA (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Unified Architecture), and the virtual and real interaction of the physical production line is used to timely reflect the operation of the workshop. From model building, model digital drive, virtual and real control joint debugging, to full life cycle workshop verification and design simulation, the visual monitoring of the digital twin workshop is finally realized.;2022 8th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR);"G.

Using UML and OCL Models to Realize High-Level Digital Twins;Digital twins constitute virtual representations of physically existing systems. However, their inherent complexity makes them difficult to develop and prove correct. In this paper we explore the use of UML and OCL, complemented with an executable language, SOIL, to build and test digital twins at a high level of abstraction. We also show how to realize the bidirectional connection between the UML models of the digital twin in the USE tool with the physical twin, using an architectural framework centered on a data lake. We have built a prototype of the framework to demonstrate our ideas, and validated it by developing a digital twin of a Lego Mindstorms car. The results allow us to show some interesting advantages of using high-level UML models to specify virtual twins, such as simulation, property checking and some other types of tests.;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"P.

Interface Development for Digital Twin of an Electric Motor Based on Empirical Performance Model;The concept of Digital Twin is creating and maintaining a digital representation of the real physical entity and supporting its performance utilizing simulation and optimization tools, which are fed with the real data obtained from the physical equipment. Development and implementation of the Digital Twin technology are one of the main challenges for today’s industry, more detailed studies are needed on design methods for Digital Twins. Besides using Digital Twin as a high-quality simulation, one of the commitments is monitoring and maintaining control of the whole system via a constant live link between virtual and physical entities.

A Model-Driven Approach for Situational Intelligence & Operational Awareness;In order to design, operate, and maintain an oil and gas facility, one must first understand its behavior. A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely. Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a “digital twin” of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system. A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation. This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.;2019 Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference Europe (PCIC EUROPE);"S.

Knowledge driven rapid development of white box digital twins for industrial plant systems;Industrial systems like power plants need a significant domain and engineering expertise for their efficient operations. Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture. Our approach to developing a DT supporting a fault management scenario in a power plant reduced 70% development time and 50% manual efforts.;IECON 2021 – 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;"A.

Interface Management with Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE);Interfaces (IF) and their Management (IFM) are a particular challenge in the successful development of complex products and products operating in a complex environment. In Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE) IFM is fully integrated into its Model-Driven Engineering Process (MDEP). CLOSE provides fully automated IF modelling, traceable IF history, an efficient handling of IF negotiations and the effective de-coupling of interfacing systems. Especially in combination with CLOSE's Experimentable Digital Twins (EDTs), IFM becomes a vital resource for the development process, rather than the parallel process it so often is today, supporting early variant evaluation, balance checks and impact analysis, which makes it a central asset for developing better products. This paper describes IFM in CLOSE and illustrates it with a case study of a Martian robot for autonomous scientific missions.;2018 IEEE International Systems Engineering Symposium (ISSE);"M.

Urban Intelligence: Toward the Digital Twin of Matera and Catania;The Urban Intelligence (UI) paradigm conceived by CNR consists of an ecosystem of digital technologies joined within a Digital Twin (DT) of the city aimed at improving the city governance towards goals addressed also by the UN Agenda 2030, such as urban environment, sustainability and resilience, wellbeing and quality of life, local development, and social inclusion. In particular, UI provides a set of candidate policies in complex scenarios, and supports policy makers and stakeholders in designing shared, evidence-based, and integrated solutions. UI is being applied for the first time to two Italian cities, Matera and Catania, paving the way for a deeper scientific framing of the paradigm, as well as for the technological development and testing of the core UI ecosystem in real-life situations.

Developing a Physical and Digital Twin: An Example Process Model;As a result of the fast development of technologies and diversity of requirements, complexity exists not only in a system itself but also in the development process and environment. The complexity in the development process comes from specialization and concurrency, and a Digital Twin (DT) has the potential to mitigate these issues. We hope, during the process of building a DT, the accidental complexity can be minimized by application of model-based systems engineering and the Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM). In this paper, we give an example of the process of building a DT combined with a process model.

Combining Low-Code Programming and SDL-Based Modeling with Snap! in the Industry 4.0 Context;One of the main challenges to implement Industry 4.0 technologies within the industrial fabric is the lack of suitable concrete models and tools that demonstrate the potential benefits of embracing the digital transformation process. To overcome this challenge, over the past years, various Industry 4.0 automation and robotics providers have presented solutions based on visual block programming languages, which follow an emerging low-code approach to reduce the entry barriers of digital technologies. However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap! to create SDL4Snap!, an open-source and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes. Overall, the resulting tool has the potential to reduce the entry barrier to Digital Twins in small and medium enterprises, which are part of the late majority and laggard groups regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0.;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"X.

A Methodology for Digital Twin Modeling and Deployment for Industry 4.0;"The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.";Proceedings of the IEEE;"G. N. Schroeder; C. Steinmetz; R. N.

Automated Model Transformation in modeling Digital Twins of Industrial Internet-of-Things Applications utilizing AutomationML;In recent years, the manufacturing industry sector has undergone major changes. Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software. The results of this approach are thereby evaluated by a real-world case study, which is applied according to the concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0).;2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );"C.

Digital Twin Service Unit for AC Motor Stator Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Detection;A modern trend for industry digitalization brings new demands for the development and application of the modeling and simulation approach. It is already not enough to have only a virtual representation of the object and run it independently from the physical object. The Digital Twin (DT) aspect indicates a connection between the physical object and the corresponding virtual twin established by generating real-time data using sensors. The DT represents physical object operation throughout its life cycle, making it an essential tool for improving that object's reliability. In this paper, an application of the DT service unit for AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection is presented. According to real-time measurements, Linux Robot Operation System (ROS) simulates AC electrical machine-specific behavior in case of unbalanced stator currents and notify about possible fault appearance and propagation. Fault, such as discussed in the paper (AC machine stator inter-turn) is considered one of the most prevalent possible electrical motor failure.;2021 28th International Workshop on Electric Drives: Improving Reliability of Electric Drives (IWED);"V.

DataTime: a Framework to smoothly Integrate Past, Present and Future into Models;Models at runtime have been initially investigated for adaptive systems. Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.;2021 ACM/IEEE 24th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS);"G.

AAS Capability-Based Operation and Engineering of Flexible Production Lines;"Lot-size-one systems as well as plug and produce concepts imply (1) producing increased variety of products in a highly flexible and timely manner, and (2) making commissioning and maintenance more flexible. The speed with which manufacturers, in particular SMEs, can reconfigure the production to a new run and thus respond to clients and avoid costly machine downtime is critical to maintaining commercial success and profit margins. The manufacturing systems of tomorrow must offer a high degree of autonomy, be quickly re-planned to other operations, and cope with a wide variety of unforeseen situations, in a secure and safe manner. In this context, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emergent standard that leverages the digital twin approach and provides concepts for describing capabilities and skills of I4.0 components in order to automate the reconfiguration process. This article proposes a capability-based operation and engineering approach to tackle the syntactic and semantic interoperability problems in flexible production lines.

Learning to Predict and Optimize Imperfect MIMO System Performance: Framework and Application;In imperfect multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, model-based methods for performance prediction and optimization generally experience degradation in the dynamically changing environment with unknown interference and uncertain channel state information (CSI). To adapt to such challenging settings and better accomplish the network auto-tuning tasks, we propose a generic learnable model-driven framework. We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results.;GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference;"J. Su; F. Meng; S.

Holistic Network Virtualization and Pervasive Network Intelligence for 6G;In this tutorial paper, we look into the evolution and prospect of network architecture and propose a novel conceptual architecture for the 6th generation (6G) networks. The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture.

In specific applications, gas turbines are used for equipment such as electrical generators, aircraft engines, high-speed boat … The applications of gas turbine are used to transmit turbine, cabinet pull in eneral[3],[5],[6],[9],[10],[12],[15]. However, there have been no published works on the use of dual turbine. This paper presents an artificial neural network controller to control Double Differential Gas Turbine (DDGT) by use algorithm to synchronize the speed of two turbines at each variable turbine load to reduce low power balance in the system. From the Rowen's model of control for a turbine, the author analyzed and combined with the existing model to construct a dual turbine combinatorial structure coupled by differential coupling. Model-driven control algorithms are used as training grounds for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace traditional PID controllers. Because the double tubine construction is strong nonlinear system, modeling is directly transformed from the object model. Simulation results for a dual-turbine twin-turbine combination of 32MW, demonstrating the suitability of the theory. Simulation results show that ANN can be deployed into practice to replace PID controllers to increase control accuracy.;2017 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE);Nguyen Hoang Mai;2017;IEEE Conferences;IEEE
