Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs – those available – to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., orthophotos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data – if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy – in the absence of BIM – are discussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better visual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures. © 2023","Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","Scopus"

Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients' engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients' care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists' collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients' quality of life.","","Article","Final","Scopus"

Model-driven engineering (MDE) methods have been proven to be effective in increasing the productivity of CPS design. However, there is still a lack of MDE approaches that enable design space exploration as well as the code generation for the design of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based CPSs. To mitigate the situation, this article presents a unified modeling language named AIoTML for AIoT-based CPSs, which enables the construction of AI-based components across different modeling levels for the purposes of intelligent sensing and control. By extending the constructs of state-of-the-art domain-specific language (DSL) ThingML, AIoTML can seamlessly unify the modeling of both autonomous executions of AIoT devices and their surrounding physical environment, which facilitates both platform-independent simulation and control optimization for platform-specific CPSs. The compiler developed for AIoTML provides a family of code generators to support the construction of digital twins on various heterogeneous target AIoT platforms. Comprehensive evaluations on two complex real-world designs demonstrate the effectiveness of our AIoTML approach in the fast development of AIoT-based CPSs with high control quality. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"

CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Article","Final","Scopus"

Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-Target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-The-Art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-Target tracking scenes.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","Final","Scopus"
