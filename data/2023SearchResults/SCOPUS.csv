In this paper, we propose a method for the alignment of the traces of both twins. Traces are sequences of snapshots that capture the progressive states of each entity. Our approach is based on a bioinformatic algorithm that we adapt and use for the alignment of snapshots. Additionally, we include a set of measures to evaluate the quality of these alignments and reason about the level of fidelity of the digital twin system. Two case studies are used to demonstrate our proposal and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness. © 2022 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142936475"

In consequence, there is an increasing interest in tools, techniques, and technologies to advance the understanding and provide unchallenging improvement of CPHS. Digital Twin is a growing research topic that can equip the CPHS with high-fidelity mirroring, monitoring, controlling, and active functional improvement. The central question in this study asks in what way Digital Twin should be designed and developed for a CPHS. An architecture was required to answer this question and build upon model to define guidelines and requirements for valid Digital Twin. Thus, this study provides much new knowledge about the emerging role of Digital Twin in CPHS by using a model-driven architecture (MDA) approach with the perspective of SD logic. In addition, in the presence of human roles, the given MDA is beneficial for providing abstractions of Digital Twin from different viewpoints, communication with non-technical experts, and decision support, system design, and improvement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","10th International Conference on Interoperability for Enterprise Systems and Applications, I-ESA2020","17 November 2020 through 19 November 2020","Virtual, Online","290669","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149705917"

This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of ""experiments""which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow. We sketch the above concepts by means of concrete examples and compare them with existing Digital Z definitions and frameworks such as the ""5D model"". © 2022 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142927915"

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.  © 2023 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","","18th IEEE/ACM Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems, SEAMS 2023","15 May 2023 through 16 May 2023","Melbourne","190661","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159598859"

To meet these requirements as well as customer needs, aircraft are regularly retrofitted with new cabins. During the planning and execution of this cabin retrofit, handling the needed and available data poses a challenge to the engineers. While much of the required data is available in some form, generally there is a lack of a digitally usable dataset of the specific aircraft—a virtual representation of the physical asset is missing. To support the implementation of such a digital twin and, thus, the overall process of retrofitting aircraft, an approach to model-driven data handling tailored to the unique circumstances and requirements of aviation is introduced. The methodology consists of a combination of systems engineering and data science techniques framed by an overarching procedure that iteratively creates and enhances a digitally accessible dataset of the relevant data, hence supporting the retrofit engineers by easing access to needed information. Besides the presentation of the research background and the methodology, a simplified example is shown, demonstrating the approach using abstracted but realistic information provided by partners from the industry. © 2023 by the authors.","MDPI","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151117371"

Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-To-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology. In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework. © 2022 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142927244"

While specific benefits depend on the individual applications, speech interfaces typically increase accessibility, enable 'hands-free' and 'no-screen' interaction, and often increase interaction speed and allow for more flexible usage patterns and increased multitasking, leading to higher user satisfaction. This paper presents a method to transfer these powerful benefits to the digital twin (DT) domain by automatically generating speech interfaces for DT applications. Our approach is based on Model Driven Engineering principles, where we automatically deduce command patterns from structural model information as used in, e.g., DT platform specifications. The speech interface generation is highly configurable and extendable, thus it can be applied to different DT models. The concepts behind the generator are generic as well, thus they can be ported to other applications and platforms. We validate our approach by applying it to two DT demonstration cases and provide a detailed description of the sketch interface configuration workflow.  © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2023","1 October 2023 through 6 October 2023","Vasteras","195746","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182401187"

Closely related to this topic arises the concept of Digital Twin, which is a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes that connect to the physical counterpart to represent, simulate, or predict changes in the physical system. There are many works that focus on supporting the high-fidelity implementation of Digital Twins for specific physical devices. However, few of them consider the process as a real-world entity to be integrated into the Digital Twin. In this work, we present a microservice architecture to support the implementation of Digital Twins for IoT-Enhanced Business Processes, considering not only the physical devices but also the process itself and the relationship among them. This architectural solution is supported by a model-driven development approach, which proposes (1) the construction of a BPMN model to represent an IoT-enhanced Business Process and (2) the application of model transformation to automatically generate both Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) models and microservice Java code templates. DTDL models are used in the implementation of the Digital Twins for the IoT-Enhanced Business Process. Java code templates are used to facilitate the implementation of the microservices required to deploy the IoT-enhanced Business Process and its Digital Twins into the proposed architecture and maintain the digital and physical parts synchronised. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","17th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Sciences, RCIS 2023","23 May 2023 through 26 May 2023","Corfu","295369","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163280406"

Intricate models complicate the definition of comprehensive testing criteria, and physical couplings make obtaining test data an arduous task. To alleviate these challenges, we explore the use of causal inference based testing and propose a technique to allow for correct behaviour of digital twins to be captured in causal diagrams, which are then tested with an efficient data set through the use of counterfactuals. We explore a motivating example of a robotic arm to show how this technique can confirm known causal relationships in a system, and even uncover a fault in the system which caused dangerous behaviour. Our technique localised this erroneous behaviour to a single causal relationship between two variables. Having shown this technique works with a case study, we explore its limitations and the challenges when approaching other industrial applications. © 2022 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142933016"

In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150296038"

Digital twin is expected to accurately estimate the real-time hydraulic parameters of blind spots of the pumping station system even under some adverse conditions including the interference of observation noise and model parameters drift. To solve these challenges, a digital twin framework integrating the model-driven method, control theory and data-driven method is presented. In this framework, an unsteady flow state estimation method combining frequency domain analysis and generalized predictive control theory is developed for the first time, which is superior to traditional time-domain numerical discrete methods in terms of computational efficiency and anti-noise interference. In the model parameter calibration process, the novelty concerns modeling of the optimization problem considering the dynamic operation control of the station and unsteady flow of pipelines. And this process is accomplished through the comprehensive application of the model-free adaptive control algorithm, the transient flow model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. This work is applied to a pumping station in a product pipeline to verify its effectiveness in estimating the transient flow state of data blind spots and map the dynamic operation behavior under the interference of colored noise and parameter drift. © 2021 ISA","ISA - Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114142278"

Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities. © 2022 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142931868"

Model-driven engineering (MDE) methods have been proven to be effective in increasing the productivity of CPS design. However, there is still a lack of MDE approaches that enable design space exploration as well as the code generation for the design of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based CPSs. To mitigate the situation, this article presents a unified modeling language named AIoTML for AIoT-based CPSs, which enables the construction of AI-based components across different modeling levels for the purposes of intelligent sensing and control. By extending the constructs of state-of-the-art domain-specific language (DSL) ThingML, AIoTML can seamlessly unify the modeling of both autonomous executions of AIoT devices and their surrounding physical environment, which facilitates both platform-independent simulation and control optimization for platform-specific CPSs. The compiler developed for AIoTML provides a family of code generators to support the construction of digital twins on various heterogeneous target AIoT platforms. Comprehensive evaluations on two complex real-world designs demonstrate the effectiveness of our AIoTML approach in the fast development of AIoT-based CPSs with high control quality. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153337913"

With modelling gaining traction for analysis-heavy use cases like decision-making and regulatory compliance where domain experts play a central role, this barrier is beginning to hurt even more. We posit that Generative AI techniques can significantly lower this barrier by enabling domain experts to construct purposive models by operating at natural language level. This requires domain experts to interact with Generative AI tools using the right purpose-specific contextual prompts. We propose a model-driven approach where purposive meta models guide the interactions between domain expert and Generative AI to generate such prompts. The proposed approach helps in overcoming some of the limitations of Generative AI such as missing local context, limited context window size, attention fading etc. Industry scale models are typically large, necessitating a team of experts to work in a coordinated manner which requires sharing of outputs and persistence across sessions. Our approach brings together MDE and Generative AI in a symbiotic relationship complimenting respective strengths and overcoming limitations. We have validated this approach for development of digital twin based applications and early results are encouraging.  © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","26th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2023","1 October 2023 through 6 October 2023","Vasteras","195411","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182329840"

Introducing IoT technologies from the early stages of the BP development process requires dealing with the complexity and heterogeneity of such technologies at design and analysis time. This paper analyzes widely used IoT frameworks and ontologies to introduce a BPMN extension that improves the expressiveness of relevant BP modeling notations and allows an appropriate representation of IoT devices from both an architectural and a behavioral perspective. In the BP management field, the use of simulation-based approaches is recognized as an effective technology for analyzing BPs. Simulation models need to be parameterized according to relevant properties of the process under study. Unfortunately, such parameters may change during the process operational life, thus making the simulation model invalid with respect to the actual process behavior. To ease the analysis of IoT-aware BPs, this paper introduces a model-driven method for the automated development of digital twins of actual business processes. The proposed method also exploits data retrieved by IoT sensors to automatically reconfigure the simulation model, to make the digital twin continuously coherent and compliant with its actual counterpart. © 2023 by the authors.","MDPI","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148850864"

To this effect, a digital twin is to be developed and configured and potentially also operated by domain experts, who rarely have a professional software engineering background and for whom easy access and support, e.g., in form of low-code platforms are missing. In this paper, we report on an integrated method for the model-driven engineering of low-code development platforms for digital twins that enables domain experts to create and operate digital twins for cyber–physical systems using the most appropriate modeling languages. The foundation of this method is (1) a code generation infrastructure for information systems combined with (2) an extensible base architecture for self-adaptive digital twins and (3) reusable language components for their configuration. Using this method, software engineers first configure the information system with the required modeling languages to generate the low-code development platform for digital twins before domain experts leverage the generated platform to create digital twins. This two-step method facilitates creating tailored low-code development platforms as well as creating and operating customized digital twins for a variety of applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129984615"

Current systems however do a poor job of coordinating the underlying rules and explaining the system's behavior to developers. This negatively impacts a system's performance due to behaving in unintended and hard-to-comprehend ways. In this vision paper, we introduce an approach that intends to alleviate these problems, for the use-case of high-performance cloud clusters, through the use of a cyber-cyber digital twin based on the Palladio ecosystem. The conceived digital twin allows for several functions that are unexplored in literature so far: the combination of design time analysis with explainability, use of state-space prediction bounded by likelihood, and explanation of non-applicability. This is achieved through a digital twin performing three main activities: 1) The predicting activity predicts system performance along several potential paths. 2) The planning activity analyzes reconfiguration rules and predicted system behavior to produce reconfiguration plans that try to optimally utilize available resources and achieve all SLOs without unintended interactions between the execution of rules. 3) The explaining activity processes all artifacts produced during system simulation time or runtime to provide comprehensive visualizations to developers. We explain how each activity is performed and what models it processes and produces based on a running example. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142919799"

Primary issues in this area stem from the absence of standardization and the complexity and heterogeneity inherent to the IoT landscape. Model-Driven Development (MDD) is considered an effective technique for IoT application development. We argue that there is a need for methodologies of MDD that encompass system development and integration, as well as organizational aspects. To compensate for this lack, this work introduces MIoTA (Modeling IoT Applications for Air Conditioning Facilities), a modeling method supporting IoT application development in the field of air conditioning facilities. The ADOxx-based MIoTA tool was developed in an industrial use case. It contains a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) and various functionalities to support the modeling and development processes, so no specific IT skills are required at the application level.

Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142923460"

First, a three-dimensional geometric model of the power transformer is built based on ANSYS Maxwell platform, including the iron core, windings, etc. Then, a digital model of the characteristic parameterization of the transformer in the digital space is established. The electromagnetic field and the temperature field based on ANSYS Workbench platform are coupled. Also, The temperature distribution of the air-immersed transformer core-winding module under six typical different working conditions is studied, and the hot spot location and temperature distribution rule under different working conditions are obtained. The simulation results of magnetic flux density, voltage and current under different operating conditions, losses and theoretical values show that the proposed DT model can effectively reflect the physical mechanism of the transformer. In addition, the simulated results show that the iron core temperature does not rise with the increase of the load rate and the winding temperature rises with the increase of the load rate. © 2023, Beijing Paike Culture Commu.

As a major part of urban energy consumptions, buildings can provide considerable regulation flexibility for the energy system by actively managing their energy demands. For the building energy flexibility (BEF) provided by thermostatically controlled loads (TCL), its dispatch performance is vulnerable to the building thermal parameter errors, and in some cases, occupants need to provide the critical information related to the indoor temperature state and the occupancy state to the energy management system outside buildings, which decreases the availability of the BEF and raises privacy concerns. For these issues in the BEF utilization, this paper proposes a data-model fusion dispatch strategy based on the digital twin (DT). The proposed strategy is capable of parameter fault tolerance and privacy protection by combining the model-free advantage of the data-driven method with the analytical optimization advantage of the model-driven method. Firstly, a DT-based BEF dispatch framework is proposed. Secondly, the building DT is established by combining the building thermal dynamics (BTD) data-driven model and the TCL operation mechanism model. And the building response deduction is carried out based on the DT. Finally, under the rolling optimization framework, the data-model fusion dispatch strategy is devised by uniting the DT deduction and the optimization constructed by the BTD mechanism model, in which the multi-dimensional modeling of the BTD is carried out from the state dimension and the energy dimension. The simulation results show that the optimization result can reach 98.4% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% parameter random error, and 98.3% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% random state noise injection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144289710"

In order to ensure that it can work normally, it is necessary to simulate and analyze the stray light situation of the whole link.

Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients' engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients' care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists' collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients' quality of life.","","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181395946"

While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.  © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2023","1 October 2023 through 6 October 2023","Vasteras","195746","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182396591"

To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system's development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","Association for Computing Machinery","FIXED Solutions; GIZA Systems; HUAWEI; Internet of Things Egypt (IOT); Open UK; Xceed","1st Federated Africa and Middle East Conference on Software Engineering, FAMECSE 2022","7 June 2022 through 8 June 2022","Virtual, Online","180962","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134887348"

The proposed approach leverages the MERODE modeling method for rapid prototyping and validation, guaranteeing robust model quality checks and enabling the creation of flexible and reusable code adaptable to different architectural settings. Data management is enhanced through the use of the SOSA/SSN ontology, enabling semantic data models and inference strategies to achieve semantic interoperability. By combining MERODE and IoT ontologies, our approach aims to take a step forward in addressing the challenges linked to system complexity and data management in the development of DT.

For supporting the development of Digital Twins, several software vendors are offering dedicated tool support, often referred to as Digital Twin platforms. The modeling capabilities of these platforms are mostly concerned with structural viewpoints, i.e., providing an overview of available components including their current and historical sensor values. However, behavioral viewpoints did not yet receive much attention on these platforms. As behavioral models are often used during the design processes, e.g., for simulation and synthesis, it would be beneficial for having them included in Digital Twin platforms, e.g., for reasoning on the set of possible next actions or for checking the execution history to perform runtime validation. In this paper, we present a catalog of modeling patterns for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavioral models and their corresponding runtime information without requiring any extension of the code bases of Digital Twin platforms. We demonstrate the presented modeling patterns by applying them to the Digital Twin platform offered by Microsoft, in an additive manufacturing use case of a 3D printer in a production line.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","De Gruyter Oldenbourg","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161546216"

Currently, a major issue arises from the lack of data integration among the different tools used during the engineering process which may cause system failures eventually. Existing tools largely do not support automatic detection and indication of erroneous or contradictory parameter values between artifacts of different tools. Employing a model-driven and functional engineering approach enables to establish an integrated toolchain for the management and visualization of engineering artifacts that consume and produce the data.

However, the definition of Digital Twin (DT) is still abstract and context-dependent. In this paper, we present a metamodel that supports concrete and operational descriptions of digital twin deployment. This metamodel encompasses the different aspects of deployment, including the definition of hardware and software components that compose the layered cyber-physical architectures of the digital twin, along with the installation and instantiation tasks that compose deployment processes. Multiple configurations can also be defined to support the deployment of a digital twin in different execution contexts. The relevance of this metamodel was evaluated by two case studies. The first consists in deploying the digital twin of a cobot in a simulation environment. The second applies the approach in a home automation environment. In both cases, our metamodel provides complete and precise descriptions of the deployment process and thus constitutes a viable first step towards a model-driven approach for digital twin deployment.  © 2022 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","27th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2022","6 September 2022 through 9 September 2022","Stuttgart","183811","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141387811"

They allow to connect various models with running systems based on bi-directional data exchange. Thus, design models can be extended with runtime views which also opens the door for many additional techniques such as identifying unexpected system changes during runtime. However, dedicated reactions to these unexpected changes, such as adapting an existing plan which has been computed in advance and may no longer be seen beneficial, are still often neglected in Digital Twins. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose so-called reactive planning that integrates Digital Twins with planning approaches to react to unforeseen changes during plan execution. In particular, we introduce an extended Digital Twin architecture which allows to integrate existing model-driven optimization frameworks. Based on this integration, we present different strategies how the replanning can be performed by utilizing the information and services available in Digital Twins. We evaluate our approach for a stack allocation case study. This evaluation yields promising results on how to effectively improve existing plans during runtime, but also allows to identify future lines of research in this area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","11th International Symposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation, ISoLA 2022","22 October 2022 through 30 October 2022","Rhodes","285429","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142747553"

However, the existing experimental-based design of high-power batteries is usually costly and inefficient, and provides limited information on the complex physicochemical processes inside the batteries. Digital twin concept is promising for capturing the batteries’ electrochemical performance, and optimizing the power capability of LIBs. Here, an electrochemical-thermal coupled model is developed as a digital twin model for rational design of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite LIBs. The model can accurately predict the batteries’ performance and help to predetermine the optimal parameters to achieve an ultrahigh power capability. After model-guided optimization, the battery shows a high energy density of 92.38 Wh kg−1 at an ultrafast discharging current of 50 C and can withstand 150 C pulse discharging tests. Notably, the digital twin model can reveal experimentally inaccessible time- and space-resolved information and identify the rate-determining steps inside the battery. Hence, model-driven optimization of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite batteries is successfully realized aiming at the critical factors in the rate-determining steps. The work provides an instructive design of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite batteries, which might guide the future direction to boost the power capability of LIBs. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141966277"

The simulation methods are classified as model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods. In addition, simulation methods in these three industries are studied from the phases of design, manufacturing, and operation. The similarities, differences and characteristics of the simulation methods applied to the automotive, aviation and maritime industries are discussed and summarized from several aspects. Model-driven approaches are used more frequently than the other two methods in design and manufacturing phases, while hybrid methods have great potential to support different operations of DT-related studies in the reviewed three industries. In addition, issues of prognostics and health management (PHM) such as fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) has recently been more inclined to be studied using data-driven approaches. According to our analysis we believe that as DT technology evolves, the hybrid approach will become the mainstream strategy for DT-based modeling.  © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","18th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications, ICIEA 2023","18 August 2023 through 22 August 2023","Ningbo","192573","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173614838"

Digital twin technology provides strong support for the achievement of cyber-physical system and intelligent manufacturing. Many investigations have been carried out for the digital twin of specific products. However, there are less researches on digital twin in the shop-floor domain, and there is a lack of model-driven digital twin comprehensive architecture. The modeling approach to the full lifecycle of digital twin is not considered enough. This paper proposes a meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin construction approach and a comprehensive architecture. A meta-model based on RAMI 4.0 is constructed, which provide a novel idea for the description of manufacturing resources and their status. The proposed shop-floor digital twin architecture consists of three key implementation elements: the meta-model construction, data modeling (including data interaction between cyber-physical spaces) and constructing different integration level models of shop-floor digital twin based on iteration feedback between the demands and models. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of the fischer learning factory 4.0. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160515920"

At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin – a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles. It addresses the problem of historically-disconnected skills required for Digital Innovation projects and it provides a testbed for feasibility experimentation.

It is the concept of creating a virtual equivalent of a real-world object that exists parallelly in the real world. With the application of real-world data, a computer program can create a simulated model that can predict or understand the working of a product or a process that may not even be present in the physical world. In short, digital twinning is a digital equivalent of any real-world object, phenomenon, or utility. A digital twin is a model driven by the Internet of Things application and it can be employed to assess the current status of the object in concern and also to forecast its future condition, controlling the behavior and optimizing its performance. Digital Twins Technology has already found its applications in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, automobile, retailing, restaurant management, smart cities, etc. This paper brings a brief insight into this emerging technology, its importance, where it can be employed and its scope in the future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","1st International Conference on Expert Clouds and Applications, ICOECA 2023","9 February 2023 through 10 February 2023","Bengaluru","297379","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168764955"

In practice, this requires analyzing, preparing for adaptation, and adapting brownfield manufacturing systems. The digital twin, a digital representation of a manufacturing system, is a key enabler for efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability. Unfortunately, the analysis and preparation of brownfield systems for adaptation, as well as the creation of digital twins, are challenging and time-consuming tasks. This paper presents an approach to automatically create digital models of systems based on 3D CAD models. To this end, the CAD data, stored as a STEP file, is analyzed to extract relevant information for a subsequent graph analysis, which is used to identify components, their dependencies, and the resulting functional modules. Finally, the gained knowledge is transformed into feature models that can be used as a digital model for configuration selection to support automatic reconfiguration planning of brownfield manufacturing systems. The developed approach is evaluated based on an industrial use case of a soft gripper system.  © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2023","1 October 2023 through 6 October 2023","Vasteras","195746","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182394999"

This requires highly adaptive, versatile cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs), which react flexibly to changes and perform crucial adjustments. Self-adaptive digital twins (DTs) enable adaptability through monitoring the behavior of a CPPS, identifying problems, and determining adjustments for the optimization of processes. DTs work with an idealized representation of the CPPS. Changes in system behavior that negatively impact the process execution, e.g., caused by tool wear or variations of environmental influences, and, thus, the quality of the resulting product, are ignored. This ignorance leads to defective products, sub-optimal product quality, and hazardous CPPS states. To mitigate this, we present an approach to incorporate quality awareness into a model-driven reference architecture of a self-adaptive DT. The devised concept automatically analyzes and optimizes system behavior. To this end, a component for quality evaluation extends the reference architecture. The DT and CPPS are connected via OPC UA. To validate the approach, a fiber laser machine is utilized. The DT can operate both on a physical and a virtual laser machine. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Just as with textual languages, the concrete syntax is the representation of the language elements intended for humans and thus has a decisive influence on the comprehensibility and usability of the language. The concrete syntax of GLML is often defined less precisely or in less detail when designing metamodels. While metamodels can be designed independently or even without concrete syntax, the latter is required for the actual usage of a graphical language. The layout and the interaction support for editing the language elements are commonly delegated to tool development. However, the development of modeling tools focuses on functionality such as model transformation and model execution, disregarding usability and handling. Low user acceptance then leads to niche applications and a limited number of users. The main reason for the lack of support for laying out and editing the language elements are complex integration challenges mainly concerning the development or adaptation of suitable layout procedures for GLML. Some frameworks offer a remedy by providing layout procedures for GLML. However, GLML differ from each other concerning their concrete syntax. Even minor differences in the concrete syntax of two languages can make the desirransferable or only transferable through complex adaptations. Formal methods for matching the concrete syntax of a GLML with existing layout procedures as early as during the development of the language are missing. In this paper, we present a classification scheme for layout procedures for GLML. The classification scheme is based on a classification scheme we developed for the concrete syntax of GLML, and it contains significant features. We define a mapping procedure between the two classifiers. As a result, the mapping decides whether a layout procedure can be used for a GLML. Both the classification scheme and the process of mapping are demonstrated in a real-world example of a technical graphical domain-specific modeling language. The presented approach supports the design of GLML and the tool development for GLML. It can be an important step towards automated tool development. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (ACM SIGSOFT); et al.; Huawei; IEEE Computer Society (IEEE CS); IEEE Computer Society, Technical Committee on Software Engineering (TCSE); University of Montreal","25th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2022","23 October 2022 through 28 October 2022","Montreal","184165","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142923407"

Engineering digital twin solutions is a knowledge and effort intensive activity. In-depth knowledge of manufacturing plant, process operations, underlying physics, data, and technical problems is essential in the design of digital twin application for a given business objective. Industry domain experts, data scientists and solution developers must collaborate to build it with the required features and functionalities. Currently, it is not an easily scalable process. For each industry vertical and even for the same plant type, the development process has to be repeated manually. To address this, we present a model-driven knowledge-based approach where knowledge can be captured in a machine processible form and reasoned with, to systematically guide the solution development process. Knowledge is modelled at three levels of abstraction, namely, meta, plant type and plant instance. We describe how this helps in generalizing the knowledge, in driving the knowledge acquisition process, and in contextualizing knowledge to specific problem instances. We then outline how the captured knowledge can be exploited to guide various digital twin engineering tasks such as problem definition, model building (physics or data-driven), data preparation, algorithm selection, etc. In particular, we discuss how the approach helps in arriving at a detailed digital twin specification starting from a high-level business problem statement. We present a case study demonstrating the approach on a real-life industrial problem.  © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","26th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2023","1 October 2023 through 6 October 2023","Vasteras","195411","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182345617"

Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-Target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-The-Art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-Target tracking scenes.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169664472"

For their efficient engineering, these twins need to become Systems-of-Systems (SoS), in which digital twins of smaller systems (e.g., a production machine) become parts of digital twins of larger systems (e.g., a factory). Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS.

Meanwhile, the demand for infertility treatment is increasing by 5–10% per year. To support the growing demand, physicians need to define personalized remote monitoring treatments supported by devices that send real-time information on hormones levels, heart-rate, temperature, etc. To this end, Healthcare Monitoring Systems (HMS) have recently appeared, based on increasingly advanced devices that help to manage this task. However, current solutions are expensive and not very customizable by physicians themselves. In this paper, we propose a framework called MoSTHealth, based on digital twins and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), allows healthcare experts to model a personalized Web of Things (WoT) HMS scenario per treatment and per patient. Thanks to MDE, the simulated scenario allows us to generate a Service-Oriented enterprise cloud architecture that integrates a prediction module based on machine learning and data analysis. In this paper, a WoT HMS scenario for infertility treatment is presented as a case study. In this scenario, a specific care plan is defined, associated with a set of devices, including the use of a biosensing device that sends hormones levels in real-time. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","22nd International Conference on Web Engineering, ICWE 2022","5 July 2022 through 8 July 2022","Bari","280139","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135047464"

Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs – those available – to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., orthophotos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data – if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the ‘two-route’ crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy – in the absence of BIM – are discussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better visual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures. © 2023","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156245607"

In the general framework presented in this work, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection. We specifically investigate the application of the proposed framework to a simple case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. The Bayesian model trained at the DT has the key advantage of capturing epistemic uncertainty regarding the communication system, e.g., regarding current traffic conditions, which arise from limited PT-to-DT data transfer. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.  © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2023","28 May 2023 through 1 June 2023","Rome","193943","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178313608"

By monitoring the consistency of digital companion flight telemetry and on-orbit actual telemtry to monitoring the occurrence of faults, and subsequently initiate model driven inference for fault diagnosis. Finally, using the simulation analysis of the digital twin model under faults, the task capability of the satellite power subsystem can be estimated before the satellite actually turns on certain power loads, so as to avoid the unexpected failure of the satellite payload task and the serious consequences of system damage.

Unfortunately, the two most commonly used modeling approaches, physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) struggle to satisfy all these requirements. In the current work, we demonstrate how a hybrid approach combining the best of PBM and DDM can result in models that can outperform both of them. We do so by combining partial differential equations based on first principles describing partially known physics with a black box DDM, in this case, a deep neural network model compensating for the unknown physics. The novelty of the work is in the theoretical contribution of presenting a sound mathematical argument for why the approach should work. The argument is backed by an array of experiments involving a two-dimensional heat diffusion problem with unknown source terms. The hybrid approach demonstrates the method's superior performance in accuracy and generalizability. Additionally, it is shown how the DDM part can be interpreted within the hybrid framework to make the overall approach reliable. The approach, as we see, will be a door opener for underutilized DDMs in high stake applications. © 2022 The Author(s)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136717010"

It converts the DC voltage from the battery into AC voltage and adjusts the frequency and amplitude to control the speed and torque of the motor.

CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems. © 2023, The Author(s).","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161725094"

Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the 'Papyrus for Manufacturing' toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning.

The objective of HAM is to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and self-evolving models. CoSTA achieves this objective by augmenting the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term generated using a deep neural network. In a series of numerical experiments on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is found to outperform comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy – often reducing predictive errors by several orders of magnitude – while also generalizing better than pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM. Its theoretical foundation also ensures that CoSTA can be used to model any system governed by (deterministic) partial differential equations. Moreover, CoSTA facilitates interpretation of the DNN-generated source term within the context of PBM, which results in improved explainability of the DNN. These factors make CoSTA a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM. © 2021 The Author(s)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120695969"

To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Springer","","","","","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172089441"

This process is error-prone and inconsistent in the enforcement of serialization rules, leading to many manual re-implementations of the Asset Administration Shell in each representation.

Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling & Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making.

Since there is no practical way to instantaneously measure it at run time, a model is required for its estimation. Recently, several data-driven SOH models have been proposed, whose accuracy heavily relies on the quality of the datasets used for their training. Since these datasets are obtained from measurements, they are limited in the variety of the charge/discharge profiles. To address this scarcity issue, we propose generating datasets by simulating a traditional battery model (e.g., a circuit-equivalent one). The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to use a simulatable battery model to evaluate a potentially infinite number of workload profiles for training the data-driven model. Furthermore, this general concept can be applied using any simulatable battery model, providing a fine spectrum of accuracy/complexity tradeoffs. Our results indicate that using simulated data achieves reasonable accuracy in SOH estimation, with a 7.2 % error relative to the simulated model, in exchange for a 27X memory reduction and a ≈ 2000X speedup. © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design, ISLPED 2023","7 August 2023 through 8 August 2023","Vienna","192744","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173078784"

In the long run, this provides us with better assessment options for software systems. © 2023 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Green And Sustainable Software, GREENS 2023","14 May 2023","Melbourne","191064","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168134336"

HMI has been widely studied in product lifecycle including product design, manufacturing, and service, but the efficiency and safety still cannot meet the new requirements for smart manufacturing along with new emerging technologies (e.g., big data, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, etc.). Digital twin (DT), as a new technology to realize cyber-physical integration, provides a new chance to address the above problems. Using a five-dimension DT model driven by real-time data, HMI will generate a more flexible interactive mode to improve machine efficiency and operation safety. In this paper, HMI in product lifecycle is investigated first, and the shortness and new requirements are analyzed, then a DT enhanced HMI framework is proposed to address the shortness. © 2019 The Authors.

This can achieve rapid response to customers and avoid costly machine downtime, which is crucial to maintaining business success and profitability. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emerging standard in the I4.0 (Industry 4.0) domain. Based on the concept of digital twins, it provides concepts for describing the digital representation of I4.0 assets including their capabilities and skills. The AAS provides also responses to the challenge of syntactic and semantic interoperability that the flexible and autonomous production lines are facing. In this article, we propose a capability-based operation and engineering approach for flexible production lines. Our approach is relying on the AAS standard which is a very wide and rich specification. Consequently, we describe the subset of AAS modelling concepts necessary for our approach, we clarify their semantics and we show their usage through a production cell use case. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these modelling concepts were tooled as an extension of the open source model-driven workbench Papyrus. © 2021 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","","47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, IECON 2021","13 October 2021 through 16 October 2021","Toronto","173927","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119507003"

Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture. Our approach to developing a DT supporting a fault management scenario in a power plant reduced 70% development time and 50% manual efforts. © 2021 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","","47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, IECON 2021","13 October 2021 through 16 October 2021","Toronto","173927","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119495014"

Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis. We also demonstrate that our digital twins framework can accurately predict driver behaviors and effectively prevent collisions using a case study in a virtual driving simulation environment. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Eclipse Foundation; HCL; JetBrains; MPS; Papyrus Industry Consortium","21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2018","14 October 2018 through 19 October 2018","Copenhagen","141115","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056832496"

These experience reports could therefore be hampering further classification and research insights by not reporting all of these relevant details about the DT solutions. We address these concerns by providing a conceptual structure for DTs as a common understanding and checklist for researchers and practitioners to precisely describe the characteristics and capabilities of their DT solutions.

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded.

In Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE) IFM is fully integrated into its Model-Driven Engineering Process (MDEP). CLOSE provides fully automated IF modelling, traceable IF history, an efficient handling of IF negotiations and the effective de-coupling of interfacing systems. Especially in combination with CLOSE's Experimentable Digital Twins (EDTs), IFM becomes a vital resource for the development process, rather than the parallel process it so often is today, supporting early variant evaluation, balance checks and impact analysis, which makes it a central asset for developing better products.

The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098780861"

In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, a reflective architecture developed around digital twins enables representation and control of system Configuration Items properly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones. © 2020, The Author(s).","Springer","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090186086"

The exemplar provided in this paper can be used to identify open challenges when it comes to Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering, and to demonstrate how approaches can solve them. This exemplar applies Digital Twins to an indoor air quality management use case, where CO2, temperature, and humidity values of rooms within a building are measured. These values can be used to derive actions to improve work productivity and reduce the risk for virus infections.

To address this difficulty, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision mechanism, can recon-struct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the tensor completion method by about 12.5% and 92.3%, respectively, in terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited. © 2021 by the authors.

Environmental and social factors should be systematically integrated into the life cycle of intelligent manufacturing. In view of this, a green performance evaluation methodology of intelligent manufacturing driven by digital twin is proposed in this paper. Digital twin framework, which constructs the bidirectional mapping and real-time data interaction between physical entity and digital model, provides the green performance evaluation with a total factor virtual image of the whole life cycle to meet the monitoring and simulation requirements of the evaluation information source and demand. Driven by the digital twin framework, a novel hybrid MCDM model based on fuzzy rough-sets AHP, multistage weight synthesis, and PROMETHEE II is proposed as the methodology for the green performance evaluation of intelligent manufacturing. The model is tested and validated on a study of the green performance evaluation of remote operation and maintenance service project evaluation for an air conditioning enterprise. Testing demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model driven by digital twin can enable a stable and reasonable evaluation result.

However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle. © 2020 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGSOFT; HCL; IEEE Computer Society Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); IncQueryLabs; Microsoft","23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2020","18 October 2020 through 23 October 2020","Virtual, Online","164265","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096963714"

However, due to the shortcomings of ideal conditions, off-line modeling and single mechanism, the traditional model driven method greatly limits the accuracy and timeliness of the model, which is difficult to assist operation and can only be applied to the design stage. As the representative of modern intelligent high-precision modeling and simulation methods, Digital Twin (DT) integrates many advanced technologies, such as Internet of things, high-speed communication, big data analysis and intelligent algorithm, which can fundamentally solve the inherent defects of traditional models. In this paper, the demand of traction power supply system for DT technology was analyzed, and the application mode of DT in energy saving was explored comprehensively. According to the actual characteristics of urban rail transit system, a DT architecture was proposed, and the key technologies of multiphysics modeling and data-driven was analyzed. DT of traction power supply system of urban rail transit will improve the real-time and effectiveness of energy-saving comprehensive analysis and control. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","1st IEEE International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence, DTPI 2021","15 July 2021 through 15 August 2021","Beijing","171890","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116147439"

This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.  © 2020 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT); HCL; IEEE Computer Society Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); IncQueryLabs","23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2020","16 October 2020 through 23 October 2020","Virtual, Online","164397","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096756100"

Digital Twins have been successfully used in many application domains, and thus, are considered as an important aspect of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, their development, maintenance, and evolution still face major challenges, in particular: (i) the management of heterogeneous models from different disciplines, (ii) the bi-directional synchronization of digital twins and the actual systems, and (iii) the support for collaborative development throughout the complete life-cycle. In the last decades, the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) community has investigated these challenges in the context of software systems. Now the question arises, which results may be applicable for digital twin engineering as well. In this paper, we identify various MDE techniques and technologies which may contribute to tackle the three mentioned digital twin challenges as well as outline a set of open MDE research challenges that need to be addressed in order to move towards a digital twin engineering discipline. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","1st International Conference on Systems Modelling and Management, ICSMM 2020","25 June 2020 through 26 June 2020","Bergen ","250379","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094117399"

Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.  © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","24th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2021","10 October 2021 through 15 October 2021","Virtual, Online","174004","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123423166"

Currently, this process is highly reliant upon manual inputs, needing 10 times more labour hours than scanning the physical asset. The resulting modelling cost counteracts the expected benefits of the digital twin. We tackle this challenge using a novel model-driven method that exploits the highly regulated and standardised nature of railways. It starts by restricting the search for OLE elements relative to point clusters of the railway masts. The resulting point clusters of the OLE elements are then converged with various parametric models of different catenary configurations to verify the presence of OLE elements and to find the best possible fit. The method outputs a geometry-only digital twin of the OLE system in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The method was tested on an 18 km railway point cloud and achieves overall detection rates of 93.2% F1 score for OLE cables and 98.1% F1 score for other OLE elements. The accuracy of the generated model is evaluated using distance-based metrics between the ground truth model and the automated model. The average modelling distance is 3.82 cm Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for all 18 km data. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

This article aims to demonstrate a novel multisource model-driven digital twin system, which is based on the geometric, physics, and sequential rule descriptions for producing a precise and real-time simulation of a robotic assembly system. In our system, the digital counterpart rendered with virtual reality technology is created and updated by the real environment information. A 3-D graphic model is reconstructed first using the geometric information of surroundings captured by the depth sensor. During interaction, a fast and efficient approach is proposed to generate the contact force and render the object deformation in the virtual environment. The virtual space also provides the sequential rule that is based on the danger field, which helps to constrain the operation of digital twin. At last, the experimental platform is established in which the virtual space is at an update rate of 100 Hz, while the automatic sorting task is performed and verified; the results show the effectiveness and applicability of the method to digital twin system.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102015160"

Together with fast-paced trends, it drives complexity and uncertainty in many domains. Yet, its potentials are manifold and, in most cases, outweigh the disadvantages. Beneath terms such as ""big data"", ""digital twin"", the term ""data-driven engineering"" has evolved over the last years. However, neither in literature nor in industry, there is a unified definition or understanding of the term. The presented research is based on a literature review as well as an industrial case study. Several databases were screened systematically for the literature review and forward and backward searches were used additionally. The case study was conducted in a collaboration with a company in the climate system sector. First, a literature-based distinction between the terms model-based, model-driven, data-based, and data-driven as well as definitions of data-driven engineering were investigated. Representatives of the company then evaluated these findings in a workshop and together with the industry partner a consistent definition was developed. The authors define data-driven engineering as a framework for product development in which the goal-oriented collection and use of sufficiently connected product lifecycle data guides and drives decisions and applications in the product development process. Further, promising use cases for the industry partner regarding data-driven engineering were formulated. The use cases were initially evaluated and prioritized regarding their cost-benefit ratio. Symbioses with other strategies of the company such as Digital Twins, model-based engineering, and solution space engineering are outlined. For academia, the presented findings provide a consistent definition that can be used as a promising direction for future research. Especially a procedure model for the systematic conception and implementation of data-driven engineering would be beneficial.

It is already not enough to have only a virtual representation of the object and run it independently from the physical object. The Digital Twin (DT) aspect indicates a connection between the physical object and the corresponding virtual twin established by generating real-time data using sensors. The DT represents physical object operation throughout its life cycle, making it an essential tool for improving that object's reliability. In this paper, an application of the DT service unit for AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection is presented. According to real-time measurements, Linux Robot Operation System (ROS) simulates AC electrical machine-specific behavior in case of unbalanced stator currents and notify about possible fault appearance and propagation. Fault, such as discussed in the paper (AC machine stator inter-turn) is considered one of the most prevalent possible electrical motor failure.  © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","28th International Workshop on Electric Drives: Improving Reliability of Electric Drives, IWED 2021","27 January 2021 through 29 January 2021","Moscow","168036","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103860218"

Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS. In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems.

However, there remains disagreement about the precise definition of a DT and the essential characteristics in the DT paradigm, such as the scope of the system-under-study and the time-scale of its communication with the DT. These experience reports could therefore be hampering further classification and research insights by not reporting all of these relevant details about the DT solutions. We address these concerns by providing a conceptual structure for DTs as a common understanding and checklist for researchers and practitioners to precisely describe the characteristics and capabilities of their DT solutions.

Engineering and monitoring interactive digital twins currently demands integrating different piecemeal technologies that effectively hinders their application and deployment. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived. We propose model-driven software engineering to realize interactive digital twins and user-specific cockpits to interact with the digital twin by generating the infrastructure from common data structure models. To this end, we present a model-driven architecture for digital twins, its integration with an interactive cockpit, and a systematic method of realizing both. Through this, modeling, deploying, and monitoring interactive digital twins becomes more feasible and fosters their successful application in smart manufacturing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","39th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, ER 2020","3 November 2020 through 6 November 2020","Vienna","251039","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097375593"

Tools and approaches in civil engineering and architectural informatics produce artifacts that are geometrical or geographical representations describing physical spaces. The models we consider conform to the CityGML standard; although relying on international standards and accessible in machine-readable formats, such physical space descriptions often lack semantic information that can be used to support analyses. In our context, analysis as commonly understood in software engineering refers to reasoning on properties of an abstracted model—in this case a city design. We support model-based development, firstly by providing a way to derive analyzable models from CityGML descriptions, and secondly, we ensure that changes performed are propagated correctly. Essentially, a digital twin of a city is kept synchronized, in both directions, with the information from the actual city. Specifically, our formal programming technique and accompanying technical framework assure that relevant information added, or changes applied to the domain (resp. analyzable) model are reflected back in the analyzable (resp. domain) model automatically and coherently. The technique developed is rooted in the theory of bidirectional transformations, which guarantees that synchronization between models is consistent and well behaved. Produced models can bootstrap graph-theoretic, spatial or dynamic analyses. We demonstrate that bidirectional transformations can be achieved in practice on real city models. © 2021, The Author(s).","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101468225"

To overcome this challenge, over the past years, various Industry 4.0 automation and robotics providers have presented solutions based on visual block programming languages, which follow an emerging low-code approach to reduce the entry barriers of digital technologies. However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap to create SDL4Snap, an open-source and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes. Overall, the resulting tool has the potential to reduce the entry barrier to Digital Twins in small and medium enterprises, which are part of the late majority and laggard groups regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)","24th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2021","10 October 2021 through 15 October 2021","Virtual, Online","175737","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123987929"

These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data-and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage. © 2021 by the authors.

Digital Twins (DTs) provide comprehensive views on such systems, the data they generate during runtime, as well as their usage and evolution over time. Setting up the required infrastructure to run a Digital Twin is still an ambitious task that involves significant upfront efforts from domain experts, although existing knowledge about the systems, such as engineering models, may be already available for reuse. To address this issue, we present AML4DT, a model-driven framework supporting the development and maintenance of Digital Twin infrastructures by employing AutomationML (AML) models. We automatically establish a connection between systems and their DTs based on dedicated DT models. These DT models are automatically derived from existing AutomationML models, which are produced in the engineering phases of a system. Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases. A case study shows the benefits of developing and maintaining DTs based on AutomationML models using the proposed AML4DT framework. For this particular study, the effort of performing the required tasks could be reduced by about 50%. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES); Malardalen University; The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2021","7 September 2021 through 10 September 2021","Virtual, Vasteras","175001","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122957318"

A core component of a DT is the virtual entity (VE) that is meant to 'mirror' the physical entity (PE). A particular challenge for developing this VE is the integration between the different models that typically make up such a VE. These models, covering different disciplines or aspects of a system, commonly are developed by different engineers and expressed in different formalisms given their strengths and weaknesses. This makes integration between these models and formalisms a challenge. Such integration has two aspects: the communication among the models, and their orchestration, which concerns the order of model step execution and data exchange. In this paper, we consider the suitability of Ptolemy II, an open source framework based on an actor-oriented structure, to implement such integration. We use the Ptolemy II framework to reproduce the implementation of a DT of an autonomous scaled-down truck, which originally required a more manual configuration and execution and was developed in a monolithic way. The results show that Ptolemy II can be used to implement different communication technologies as actors, and show the expressiveness of the orchestrators by reproducing the existing DT's behavior. This shows Ptolemy II in principle to be suitable as an integration and orchestration tool for models in the context of DTs. As future work, we plan to apply the framework to more complex DTs using different communication technologies, so as to validate its broader suitability for VE orchestration in DTs. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)","24th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2021","10 October 2021 through 15 October 2021","Virtual, Online","175737","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124028959"

Due to the significant complexity of systems subject to digital twinning, constructing simulators of appropriate details is a costly and error-prone endeavor. To alleviate these problems, we propose an approach for inferring simulation models of Digital Twins by machine learning. Instead of learning the simulation model of one specific simulator, we aim at learning their construction process. This generality enables reusing the inferred knowledge in different (but congruent) Digital Twin settings. To achieve this level of generality, we propose the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism for capturing simulation models; and reinforcement learning (RL) for inferring DEVS models. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges in combining these two techniques. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)","24th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2021","10 October 2021 through 15 October 2021","Virtual, Online","175737","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124024999"

The technical characteristics of DT and AI were analysed to control spatial changes according to the user’s emotional state and to address safety-related issues. Furthermore, a fusion mechanism for DT and AI was developed for intelligent motor control to change the dimensions of the space in order to improve the EEG state of the user. In addition, using an AI model that converts EEG data into emotional state information, the user’s emotional state was analysed, and key issues related to the spatial dimensions and change of space that induce psychological stability were investigated. © 2021 by the author.

To adapt to such challenging settings and better accomplish the network auto-tuning tasks, we propose a generic learnable model-driven framework. We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results. © 2022 IEEE.","","","2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2022","4 December 2022 through 8 December 2022","Virtual, Online","185952","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134382971"

In this paper we explore the use of UML and OCL, complemented with an executable language, SOIL, to build and test digital twins at a high level of abstraction. We also show how to realize the bidirectional connection between the UML models of the digital twin in the USE tool with the physical twin, using an architectural framework centered on a data lake. We have built a prototype of the framework to demonstrate our ideas, and validated it by developing a digital twin of a Lego Mindstorms car. The results allow us to show some interesting advantages of using high-level UML models to specify virtual twins, such as simulation, property checking and some other types of tests. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)","24th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2021","10 October 2021 through 15 October 2021","Virtual, Online","175737","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123990225"

The Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communications will provide a wide range of new applications and business opportunities, but with a wide and quite complex attack surface. Several users are not aware of the underlying threats and most of them do not possess the knowledge to set and operate the various digital assets securely. Therefore, cyber security training is becoming mandatory both for simple users and security experts. Cyber ranges constitute an advance training technique where trainees gain hands-on experiences on a safe virtual environment, which can be a realistic digital twin of an actual system.

A twin synchronization method of four-dimensional fusion model based on real-time production data was proposed. The concept of twin synchronization was explained from behavior real-time mapping, state real-time mapping and action real-time mapping. The key implementation technologies for twin synchronization such as multi-source heterogeneous data classification, cleaning and analysis and four-dimensional fusion model driven by real-time production data were elaborated in detail. Meanwhile, the prototype system was designed and developed, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by a practical case study.

Development and implementation of Digital Twin technology is a hot topic in many industry-oriented research projects. However, more detailed studies are needed on design methods for Digital Twins, which allows full synchronization and connectivity between virtual and real environments. This paper presents a development case study of Digital Twin for an electric motor based on an empirical performance model. The paper discusses the way how the data required for the Digital Twin were obtained and present a detailed structural description of the virtual entity.

Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system's executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system's environment based on the data recorded by the system's digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study.

Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a 'digital twin' of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system.A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns.

Automation systems are getting more production friendly by being more reconfigurable and adaptable. The plant engineering process is also getting improved by offering modular architecture, model-based engineering, etc. This transformation necessitates novel methodologies in maintenance practices as well. With the emergence of predictive maintenance techniques, sometimes it is possible to predict a breakdown and thus conveniently schedule the corrective maintenance. But this is not always the case, the incidence of unscheduled corrective maintenance is prevalent in an industrial environment. And the methodologies for corrective maintenance have to be reshaped fitting to the new plant environment. This paper introduces a new modular corrective maintenance methodology, using the digital twin of an automation module. Fault ascription support for a human technician, performing corrective maintenance action of an automation module is provided by its digital twin and associated visual interface. A use case scenario is propounded and future visions are presented. © 2018","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052966280"

This use of DTs however requires that the physical entities to control be described at different levels of detail. For example, simple I/O models are used to compute parameters of modulating controllers, more time-accurate ones may be required to set up and assess logic controls, high-accuracy, possibly nonlinear ones may serve for overall strategy verification, and for software-in-the-loop testing, also the host computing/network architecture needs representing. In such a complex scenario, guaranteeing that all the descriptions of all elements are consistent with one another is a relevant problem. We discuss this matter and propose a solution, in the form of a modelling paradigm where - as a novel contributions - relationships (in a sense analogous to what the term means in database theory) can be instated and enforced. This allows to create and maintain knowledge based made of interrelate data and models, embracing all the major DT interpretations proposed so far in the literature, or said more explicitly, combining data-driven and model-driven DTs in a single framework.

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins. © 2020 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGSOFT; HCL; IEEE Computer Society Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); IncQueryLabs; Microsoft","23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2020","18 October 2020 through 23 October 2020","Virtual, Online","164265","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096992990"

Our genomes, disease histories, behavior, and lifestyles are all different. It is not too surprising, therefore, that we often respond differently to the drugs we receive. Cancer, in particular, is a complex and heterogeneous disease, originating in patients with different genomes, in cells with different epigenomes, formed and evolving on the basis of random processes, with the response to therapy not only depending on the individual cancer cell but also on many features of the patient. Selection of an optimal therapy will therefore require a deep molecular analysis comprising both the patient and their tumor (e.g., comprehensive molecular tumor analysis [CMTA]), and much better personalized prediction of response to possible therapies. Currently, we are at an inflection point in which advances in technology, decreases in the costs of sequencing and other molecular analyses, and increases in computing power are converging, forming the foundation to build a data-driven approach to personalized oncology. Here, we discuss the deep molecular characterization of individual tumors and patients as the basis of not only current precision oncology but also of computational models (‘digital twins’), forming the foundation of a truly personalized therapy selection of the future. © 2019, The Author(s).","Springer Verlag","","","","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070840995"

One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS's behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models""are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES); Institute of Computer Technology from TU Wien; The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation, ETFA 2020","8 September 2020 through 11 September 2020","Vienna","163774","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093356602"

In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.  © 2020 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGSOFT; Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers","42nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops, ICSEW 2020","27 June 2020 through 19 July 2020","Seoul","163291","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093092203"

Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area.

Evolution of multi-agent systems from purely decision-making support and simulation tool to cyber-physical system including Digital Twins and fully autonomous systems is analyzed. The main paper contribution is the proposed conceptual framework for designing autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management. It is shown in the paper that, in cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management, the ontology-customized multi-agent engine and ontology-based model of enterprise are forming ontology-driven “Digital Twin” of the enterprise providing opportunity to combine operational scheduling of resources with ongoing real-time simulations and evolutional re-design of configuration of enterprise resources. The functionality and architecture of the autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are developed to support for the full cycle of autonomous decision making on resource management. Time metrics for measuring event-based response time and level of adaptability of autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are proposed.

Considering the robotics demonstrator for the Digital Thread concept used in Confirm, which is a small cyberphysical system based on the UR3 cobot and a web controller for it, we apply Active Automata Learning in order to obtain a Digital Twin for it. Behavior mining done in this fashion is nowadays uncommon, but it has various advantages over, e.g., models obtained with popular AI techniques in that the AAL models are accurate deterministic behavioural explanations for the system behaviour at the chosen level of abstraction, and they may be further amenable to formal verification, e.g., by model checking, in order to establish properties of interest. This extension has the effect of showcasing the Digital Twin concept, the AAL technique, the use of model checking, and the importance of working with formal models that are amenable to these technologies. We then reflect on the nature of the models and their uses and meaning, from the point of view of the comments and questions we receive in the demonstrations. We also consider the use of a feature-based approach to modelling the systems and their interactions, which is a further aspect for which the demonstrator could be used, with a special attention to the aspects of this work, like AAL and the feature based and feature interaction research, that connect directly with the collaboration with and the research of Bengt Jonsson. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120864161"

Commonly, a digital twin is defined based on a virtual entity (VE) that exhibits similar behavior to its physical counterpart, and that is coupled to this physical entity (PE). The VE thus forms a core part of any digital twin. While VEs may differ vastly - from ones based on simple simulation to high-fidelity virtual mirroring of the corresponding PE - they are typically composed of multiple models that may originate from multiple domains, address different aspects, and are expressed and processed using different tools and languages. Furthermore, the use of time series data - whether historical or real-time or both - from the PE distinguishes VEs from mere simulations. As a consequence of the modeling landscape complexity and the data aspect of VEs, the design of a digital twin and specifically of the VE as part of it represents several challenges. In this paper, we present our vision for the development, evolution, maintenance, and verification of such virtual entities for digital twins. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM); IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Council on Software Engineering (TCSE); Special Interest Group on Software Engineering (SIGSOFT)","24th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2021","10 October 2021 through 15 October 2021","Virtual, Online","175737","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124001119"

The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture.

These are useful to urban areas in the Philippines through diversified applications: urban planning, disaster mitigation, environmental monitoring, and policy making. This study explored the use of free and open-source software to generate an LOD1 and LOD2 3D city model of Tanauan City, Batangas using building footprints from OpenStreetMap and elevation models from Taal Open LiDAR data. The proposed approach consists of GIS-based methods including data pre-processing, building height extraction, roof identification, building reconstruction, and visualization. The study adopted methods from previous studies for building detection and from Zheng et al. (2017) for LOD2 building reconstruction. For LOD1, a decision tree classifier was devised to determine the appropriate height for building extrusion. For LOD2, a model-driven approach using multipatch surfaces was utilized for building reconstruction. The workflow was able to reconstruct 70.66% LOD1 building models and 55.87% LOD2 building models with 44.37% overall accuracy. The RMSE and MAE between the extracted heights from the workflow and from manual digitization has an accuracy lower than 1 m which was within the standards of CityGML. The processing time in test bench 1 and test bench 2 for LOD1 took 00:12:54.5 and 00:09:27.2 while LOD2 took 02:50:29.1 and 01:27:48.2, respectively. The results suggest that the efficient generation of LOD1 and LOD2 3D city models from open data can be achieved in the FOSS environment using less computationally intensive GIS-based algorithms.  © International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","2021 Philippine Geomatics Symposium 2021","17 November 2021 through 19 November 2021","Virtual, Online","175816","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122311297"

The Model-Driven Engineering Process (MDEP) addresses this by providing clearly defined insert points for domain models and simulation engines. In Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE) Experimentable Digital Twins (EDTs) are integrated in the MDEP to realistically simulate how system functions would be executed by physical parts of the developed product. CLOSE thus can reduce the cycle times for analysis, design, development, optimisation, and some of the verification. This paper introduces the basic concept of CLOSE and illustrates its application with a case study. © 2018 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society; SDI","4th IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, ISSE 2018","1 October 2018 through 3 October 2018","Roma","143143","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059973689"

Existing process design methods are inefficient to quickly handle the machining plan changed induced by the unpredictable events in real-time production. It inevitably causes time and economic losses for the enterprise. In order to express the evolutionary characteristics of product processing, the construction method of digital twin process model (DTPM) is proposed based on the knowledge-evolution machining features. Three key technologies include correlation structure of process knowledge, expression method of the evolution geometric features and the association mechanism between two are solved. On this basis, the construction framework of DTPM is illustrated. Then, the organisation and management mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous data is discussed in detail. At last, a case study of the complex machined part is researched, the results show that the processing time reduced by about 7% and the processing stability improved by 40%. Meanwhile, the implementation scheme, application process and effect of this case are described in detail to provide reference for enterprises. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101211211"
