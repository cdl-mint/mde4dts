Using UML and OCL Models to Realize High-Level Digital Twins;"A Digital Twin (DT) is a comprehensive digital representation of an actual system, service or product (the Physical Twin,
PT), synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity [19].
The digital twin includes the properties, condition and behavior of the physical entity through models and data, and
is continuously updated with real-time system data about the
PT performance, maintenance, and health status throughout its
entire lifetime [4], [6], [20]. The exchange of data between
the digital and the physical twins takes place through bidirectional data connections. This is why many authors have
argued that a DT system contains three dimensions: physical,
