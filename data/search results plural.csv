0;Air Quality Management: An Exemplar for Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering;"H. S. Govindasamy; R. Jayaraman; B. Taspinar; D. Lehner; M. Wimmer";2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);2021.0;Since its first mentioning in the literature, the concept of Digital Twin has gained traction in both industry and academia. However, there are still many open challenges when applying Digital Twins to industry-scale use cases. Applying Model-Driven Engineering techniques to the creation and maintenance of Digital Twins (also referred to as Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering) promises automation and consistency throughout the life cycle of a Digital Twin. The exemplar provided in this paper can be used to identify open challenges when it comes to Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering, and to demonstrate how approaches can solve them. This exemplar applies Digital Twins to an indoor air quality management use case, where CO2, temperature, and humidity values of rooms within a building are measured. These values can be used to derive actions to improve work productivity and reduce the risk for virus infections. We describe three applications that make use of this Digital Twin (i.e., runtime visualization, physical simulation, and ML-based predictions), and provide an online repository with the artefacts of this exemplar.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
1;The Research of Aero-engine Digital Twin Model Based on Model-driven and Data-driven Fusion Method;"K. Liu; P. Wang; Q. Li";2021 IEEE 10th Data Driven Control and Learning Systems Conference (DDCLS);2021.0;With the rapid development of multi-field physical modeling, sensor network, big data processing and analysis and other information technologies, digital twin technology is gradually applied in the field of complex equipment operation and maintenance. Aero-engine is a typical complex equipment. The accurate monitoring in operation and performance degradation assessment and prediction are the key problems in maintenance. According to the definition of digital, the paper puts forward the concept of aero-engine digital twin and constructs an aero-engine digital twin model based on precise physical models, historical data and sensors data. The aero-engine digital twin model can predict the physical properties and can be applied to accurate monitoring in operation and performance degradation assessment and prediction.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
2;Generative and Model-driven SDK development for the Industrie 4.0 Digital Twin;"N. Braunisch; M. Ristin-Kaufmann; R. Lehmann; H. W. van de Venn";2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );2021.0;Industrie 4.0 maps the digital twin as the Asset Administration Shell. To develop this digital twin, the Asset Administration Shell meta-model is used. A developer needs high-quality libraries in their programming languages to build the Asset Administration Shell in efficient and ergonomic way. The existing representations of the meta-model are inconvenient for moving from the specification to realizations in software development. This leads to many, often manual, re-implementations of the Asset Administration Shell in each programming language. We present an approach to automatically generate libraries based on the intermediate representation of the meta-model. The approach allows for practical and simple development process of Industrie 4.0 components, and scales across programming environments and future changes in the meta-model.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
3;Towards a Reference Architecture for Leveraging Model Repositories for Digital Twins;"D. Lehner; S. Wolny; A. Mazak-Huemer; M. Wimmer";2020 25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);2020.0;"In the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the degree of complexity continuously increases mainly due to new key-enabling technologies supporting those systems. One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS’s behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models"" are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case.";IEEE;IEEE Conferences
4;Digital Twin Operational Platform for Connectivity and Accessibility using Flask Python;"M. S. Bonney; M. de Angelis; D. Wagg; M. D. Borgo";2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);2021.0;This paper demonstrates an example of an open-source, modular, and system independent framework that has been developed by a team of researchers working for the UK based DigiTwin project. The example in this paper is based on a framework for a digital twin operational platform (DTOP) that uses Flask Python, and is named DTOP-Cristallo. DTOPCristallo is an operational platform that uses HTML web pages as the interface between the digital twin simulations, both python based and 3rd party software based, and the user. This framework is particularly useful for connectivity with users, since it can deploy the digital twin with multiple accessibility options to accommodate a wide variety of intended uses.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
5;An EV-Traction Inverter Data-Driven Modelling for Digital Twin Development;"M. Ibrahim; H. A. Raja; A. Rassõlkin; T. Vaimann; A. Kallaste";2023 23rd International Scientific Conference on Electric Power Engineering (EPE);2023.0;Digital Twin (DT) technology has achieved a significant breakthrough in the development of numerous applications, including electric vehicles (EVs). This technique involves the creation of a virtual version of a real object, utilizing simulation and optimization tools with real data to optimize its functioning. The traction inverter is considered the brain of the EV drive system, as it controls the power flow between the battery and the electric motor. It converts the DC voltage from the battery into AC voltage and adjusts the frequency and amplitude to control the speed and torque of the motor. This research work presents the DT modelling procedures of an EV traction inverter. The basic principles of DT are discussed, and the model-driven DT modelling technique is compared to the data-driven. The motor-drive physical model (test bench) is provided. A data-driven model of the inverter was generated using a nonlinear regression-based artificial neural network ANN. Historical data from experimental tests were used as a modeling reference. The obtained results from the data-driven model achieved high prediction accuracy.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
6;Inference of Simulation Models in Digital Twins by Reinforcement Learning;"I. David; J. Galasso; E. Syriani";2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);2021.0;"The typical optimization and control activities of Digital Twins are driven by high-performance simulators. Due to the significant complexity of systems subject to digital twinning, constructing simulators of appropriate details is a costly and error-prone endeavor. To alleviate these problems, we propose an approach for inferring simulation models of Digital Twins by machine learning. Instead of learning the simulation model of one specific simulator, we aim at learning their construction process. This generality enables reusing the inferred knowledge in different (but congruent) Digital Twin settings. To achieve this level of generality, we propose the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism for capturing simulation models; and reinforcement learning (RL) for inferring DEVS models. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges in combining these two techniques.";IEEE;IEEE Conferences
7;Data- and model-driven digital twins for design and logistics control of product distribution;"M. Stan; T. Borangiu; S. R?ileanu";2021 23rd International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science (CSCS);2021.0;Digital control of product-on-pallet distribution is organized on two layers in logistics systems: the low-level local process automation and the supervision and coordination dual logistic execution system. The paper's scientific contribution consists in a holonic control system for multiple robot palletizing cells for product-on-pallet distribution. In this holonic control approach, data-driven digital twins (DT) are created to optimize palletizing schedules, controlled with situation awareness and resource health monitoring. A model-driven DT configuration with embedded simulation faster than real-time is combined with the data-driven DT in a meta-level control scheme offering predictive situation awareness. The paper also presents a pure model-driven DT mock-up of a robot palletizing cell - simulation with software in the loop - in which the actual holonic control system including digital twins and decision making is used in the simulation as it will be deployed in reality. This configuration is used to design the robot palletizing cells, to experiment in limit conditions, to fine tune and validate the robot control solution.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
8;Using Ptolemy II as a Framework for Virtual Entity Integration and Orchestration in Digital Twins;"D. A. M. Negrin; L. Cleophas; M. Van Den Brand";2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);2021.0;The concept of Digital Twin (DT) is increasingly getting attention due to its support for digital transformation as part of Industry 4.0. A core component of a DT is the virtual entity (VE) that is meant to ‘mirror’ the physical entity (PE). A particular challenge for developing this VE is the integration between the different models that typically make up such a VE. These models, covering different disciplines or aspects of a system, commonly are developed by different engineers and expressed in different formalisms given their strengths and weaknesses. This makes integration between these models and formalisms a challenge. Such integration has two aspects: the communication among the models, and their orchestration, which concerns the order of model step execution and data exchange. In this paper, we consider the suitability of Ptolemy II, an open source framework based on an actor-oriented structure, to implement such integration. We use the Ptolemy II framework to reproduce the implementation of a DT of an autonomous scaled-down truck, which originally required a more manual configuration and execution and was developed in a monolithic way. The results show that Ptolemy II can be used to implement different communication technologies as actors, and show the expressiveness of the orchestrators by reproducing the existing DT’s behavior. This shows Ptolemy II in principle to be suitable as an integration and orchestration tool for models in the context of DTs. As future work, we plan to apply the framework to more complex DTs using different communication technologies, so as to validate its broader suitability for VE orchestration in DTs.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
9;A software engineering point of view on digital twin architecture;"G. Béchu; A. Beugnard; C. G. L. Cao; Q. Perez; C. Urtado; S. Vauttier";2022 IEEE 27th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);2022.0;Digital twins, along with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, have been identified as one of the key technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the definition of Digital Twin (DT) is still abstract and context-dependent. In this paper, we present a metamodel that supports concrete and operational descriptions of digital twin deployment. This metamodel encompasses the different aspects of deployment, including the definition of hardware and software components that compose the layered cyber-physical architectures of the digital twin, along with the installation and instantiation tasks that compose deployment processes. Multiple configurations can also be defined to support the deployment of a digital twin in different execution contexts. The relevance of this metamodel was evaluated by two case studies. The first consists in deploying the digital twin of a cobot in a simulation environment. The second applies the approach in a home automation environment. In both cases, our metamodel provides complete and precise descriptions of the deployment process and thus constitutes a viable first step towards a model-driven approach for digital twin deployment.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
10;Analysis of digital twin application of urban rail power supply system for energy saving;"Y. Wang; G. Zhang; R. Chen; Z. Liu; R. Qiu";2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI);2021.0;Energy saving analysis and control of urban rail traction power supply system are usually based on the traditional model driven method. However, due to the shortcomings of ideal conditions, off-line modeling and single mechanism, the traditional model driven method greatly limits the accuracy and timeliness of the model, which is difficult to assist operation and can only be applied to the design stage. As the representative of modern intelligent high-precision modeling and simulation methods, Digital Twin (DT) integrates many advanced technologies, such as Internet of things, high-speed communication, big data analysis and intelligent algorithm, which can fundamentally solve the inherent defects of traditional models. In this paper, the demand of traction power supply system for DT technology was analyzed, and the application mode of DT in energy saving was explored comprehensively. According to the actual characteristics of urban rail transit system, a DT architecture was proposed, and the key technologies of multiphysics modeling and data-driven was analyzed. DT of traction power supply system of urban rail transit will improve the real-time and effectiveness of energy-saving comprehensive analysis and control.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
11;Digital Twins for Sustainable Software Systems;"M. Heithoff; A. Hellwig; J. Michael; B. Rumpe";2023 IEEE/ACM 7th International Workshop on Green And Sustainable Software (GREENS);2023.0;Sustainable software systems aim to create resource-efficient software products and reduce the carbon impact of applications. Current approaches for sustainability assessment of software are either only focused on their operation or rely on methods in their engineering. More holistic approaches for sustainable software system spanning are missing. Thus, we are interested in the engineering of sustainable software systems together with the monitoring of their sustainability goals over their whole lifetime. Within this paper, we suggest using digital twins to accompany software systems in all life cycle phases with a specific focus on using model-driven engineering methods for the creation of applications. We can generate accompanying digital twins which share relevant models and data with the actual system and provide services for the assessment of sustainability indicators. In the long run, this provides us with better assessment options for software systems.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The integration of process mining functionalities with model-driven digital twin architectures raises the question which models are important for the model-driven engineering of digital twins at designtime and at runtime. Currently, research on process mining and model-driven digital twins is conducted in different research communities. Within this position paper, we motivate the need for the holistic combination of both research directions to facilitate harnessing the data and the models of the systems of the future at runtime. The presented position is based upon continuous discussions, workshops, and joint research between process mining experts and software engineering experts in the Internet of Production excellence cluster. We aim to motivate further joint research into the combination of process mining techniques with model-driven digital twins to efficiently combine data and models at runtime.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
13;AML4DT: A Model-Driven Framework for Developing and Maintaining Digital Twins with AutomationML;"D. Lehner; S. Sint; M. Vierhauser; W. Narzt; M. Wimmer";2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );2021.0;As technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming ubiquitous, systems adopting these technologies are getting increasingly complex. Digital Twins (DTs) provide comprehensive views on such systems, the data they generate during runtime, as well as their usage and evolution over time. Setting up the required infrastructure to run a Digital Twin is still an ambitious task that involves significant upfront efforts from domain experts, although existing knowledge about the systems, such as engineering models, may be already available for reuse. To address this issue, we present AML4DT, a model-driven framework supporting the development and maintenance of Digital Twin infrastructures by employing AutomationML (AML) models. We automatically establish a connection between systems and their DTs based on dedicated DT models. These DT models are automatically derived from existing AutomationML models, which are produced in the engineering phases of a system. Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases. A case study shows the benefits of developing and maintaining DTs based on AutomationML models using the proposed AML4DT framework. For this particular study, the effort of performing the required tasks could be reduced by about 50%.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
14;Twin Process Model Driven Machining Quality Optimization for Complex Parts;"J. Li; G. Zhou; C. Zhang";2021 International Conference on Digital Society and Intelligent Systems (DSInS);2021.0;Machining process of complex parts is high-performance processing with equal emphasis on geometric accuracy and physical performance indicators, and its machining quality directly affects service performance. Process optimization based on digital twin is considered as an intelligent method to link machining process and process design, which is benefit to the scientific control of machining quality. This paper summarizes the evolution and development of process model and proposes twin process model, which could support the machining quality optimization of complex parts. What’s more, industrial application of twin process model is introduced through three steps, namely mapping relationship between machine operation data and instruction domain, simulation and monitoring of machining surface roughness, and optimization of machining parameter based on twin process model. Finally, the proposed twin process model could provide theoretical support for machining quality control.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
15;Concept of a Modular and System Model Driven Digital Twin for Engineering Education;"F. Wilking; M. Behringer; M. Fett; S. Goetz; E. Kirchner; S. Wartzack";2023 18th Annual System of Systems Engineering Conference (SoSe);2023.0;Driven by the opportunities for condition monitoring and new business models, Digital Twins have become a popular topic within research and industrial application over the last years. Therefore, universities must integrate the development of Digital Twins into their educational program to enable future engineers to overcome the challenges concomitant with Digital Twins. While a theoretical basis for Digital Twins is crucial e.g., hardware-software integration, Internet of Things (IoT) or simulation models, a practical combination of these heterogeneous components is also necessary to introduce the Digital Twin as a whole concept. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) an approach was introduced to grasp complexity by using system models e.g., through SysML diagrams. Digital Twins are an example for advanced systems shaped by high complexity. The usage of system models is therefore likely. With this contribution, a concept is presented to combine system models and Digital Twins to create a prototype for academic education and the conduction of student projects.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
16;Integration Challenges for Digital Twin Systems-of-Systems;"J. Michael; J. Pfeiffer; B. Rumpe; A. Wortmann";2022 IEEE/ACM 10th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems (SESoS);2022.0;Research and industry leverage digital twins to monitor and control (cyber-physical) systems in various domains. For their efficient engineering, these twins need to become Systems-of-Systems (SoS), in which digital twins of smaller systems (e.g., a production machine) become parts of digital twins of larger systems (e.g., a factory). Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS. These insights may guide future research on engineering digital twins as well as practitioners considering the challenges in building and composing digital twin systems-of-systems.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
17;Models Meet Data: Challenges to Create Virtual Entities for Digital Twins;"M. Van Den Brand; L. Cleophas; R. Gunasekaran; B. Haverkort; D. A. M. Negrin; H. M. Muctadir";2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);2021.0;In recent years, digital twin (DT) technology has moved to the center of attention of many researchers and engineers. Commonly, a digital twin is defined based on a virtual entity (VE) that exhibits similar behavior to its physical counterpart, and that is coupled to this physical entity (PE). The VE thus forms a core part of any digital twin. While VEs may differ vastly—from ones based on simple simulation to high-fidelity virtual mirroring of the corresponding PE—they are typically composed of multiple models that may originate from multiple domains, address different aspects, and are expressed and processed using different tools and languages. Furthermore, the use of time series data—whether historical or real-time or both—from the PE distinguishes VEs from mere simulations. As a consequence of the modeling landscape complexity and the data aspect of VEs, the design of a digital twin and specifically of the VE as part of it represents several challenges. In this paper, we present our vision for the development, evolution, maintenance, and verification of such virtual entities for digital twins.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
18;Multisource Model-Driven Digital Twin System of Robotic Assembly;"X. Li; B. He; Y. Zhou; G. Li";IEEE Systems Journal;2021.0;"The digital twin technology effectively fuels improvements in the quality and efficiency of robotic assembly, especially for sophisticated processes. High-quality digitalization requires a comprehensive description and real-time rendering of system, which are challenging. This article aims to demonstrate a novel multisource model-driven digital twin system, which is based on the geometric, physics, and sequential rule descriptions for producing a precise and real-time simulation of a robotic assembly system. In our system, the digital counterpart rendered with virtual reality technology is created and updated by the real environment information. A 3-D graphic model is reconstructed first using the geometric information of surroundings captured by the depth sensor. During interaction, a fast and efficient approach is proposed to generate the contact force and render the object deformation in the virtual environment. The virtual space also provides the sequential rule that is based on the danger field, which helps to constrain the operation of digital twin. At last, the experimental platform is established in which the virtual space is at an update rate of 100 Hz, while the automatic sorting task is performed and verified; the results show the effectiveness and applicability of the method to digital twin system.";IEEE;IEEE Journals
19;Semantic Interoperability of Digital Twins: Ontology-based Capability Checking in AAS Modeling Framework;"Y. Huang; S. Dhouib; L. P. Medinacelli; J. Malenfant";2023 IEEE 6th International Conference on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS);2023.0;Industry 4.0 currently prepares a major shift towards extreme flexibility into production lines management. Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the “Papyrus for Manufacturing” toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning. This paper showcases this approach through a robotic cell use case.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Nordvik";2019 Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference Europe (PCIC EUROPE);2019.0;In order to design, operate, and maintain an oil and gas facility, one must first understand its behavior. A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely. Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a “digital twin” of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system. A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation. This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
30;Knowledge driven rapid development of white box digital twins for industrial plant systems;"A. B.; S. R.C.; B. B.; R. Dhakshinamoorthy; S. A.; N. S.";IECON 2021 – 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;2021.0;Industrial systems like power plants need a significant domain and engineering expertise for their efficient operations. Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture. Our approach to developing a DT supporting a fault management scenario in a power plant reduced 70% development time and 50% manual efforts.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

In Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE) IFM is fully integrated into its Model-Driven Engineering Process (MDEP). CLOSE provides fully automated IF modelling, traceable IF history, an efficient handling of IF negotiations and the effective de-coupling of interfacing systems. Especially in combination with CLOSE's Experimentable Digital Twins (EDTs), IFM becomes a vital resource for the development process, rather than the parallel process it so often is today, supporting early variant evaluation, balance checks and impact analysis, which makes it a central asset for developing better products. This paper describes IFM in CLOSE and illustrates it with a case study of a Martian robot for autonomous scientific missions.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
32;Prediction Study of the Heavy Vehicle Driving State Based on Digital Twin Model;"J. Liu; Y. Dong; Y. Liu; P. Li; S. Liu; T. Wang";2021 IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Computer Applications (ICPECA);2021.0;"In order to study the driving state of heavy vehicles, two approaches are employed hereby to establish digital twin models for analyzing the applicable scopes of the models and conducting a predictive study. To begin with, the operating parameters and the state of the vehicles are measured using instruments and apparatuses. Then, relying on a GP and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), two digital twin models of vehicles driving state are established, respectively, which set the transmission system and power system parameters as well as weather conditions as input parameters; and vehicle running speed and torque value as output ones. Both digital twin models consider the physical rule of the vehicle to avoid overfitting in the training. The analytical results indicate that the GP-based digital twin model appears more accurate in predicting the driving parameters of the vehicles, whereas the model based on the DCNN has better convergence precision within a short span of time. The vehicle-specific digital twin models set up in this paper lay a foundation for subsequent optimization of vehicle driving state and realization of digital twin-physical entity interaction.";IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Pereira";Proceedings of the IEEE;2021.0;"The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article.

36;Combining Low-Code Programming and SDL-Based Modeling with Snap! in the Industry 4.0 Context;"X. P. i. Palomés; P. Tuset-Peiró; P. F. i. Casas";2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);2021.0;One of the main challenges to implement Industry 4.0 technologies within the industrial fabric is the lack of suitable concrete models and tools that demonstrate the potential benefits of embracing the digital transformation process. To overcome this challenge, over the past years, various Industry 4.0 automation and robotics providers have presented solutions based on visual block programming languages, which follow an emerging low-code approach to reduce the entry barriers of digital technologies. However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap! to create SDL4Snap!, an open-source and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes. Overall, the resulting tool has the potential to reduce the entry barrier to Digital Twins in small and medium enterprises, which are part of the late majority and laggard groups regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Lüder";2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );2021.0;In recent years, the manufacturing industry sector has undergone major changes. Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software. The results of this approach are thereby evaluated by a real-world case study, which is applied according to the concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0).;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

It is already not enough to have only a virtual representation of the object and run it independently from the physical object. The Digital Twin (DT) aspect indicates a connection between the physical object and the corresponding virtual twin established by generating real-time data using sensors. The DT represents physical object operation throughout its life cycle, making it an essential tool for improving that object's reliability. In this paper, an application of the DT service unit for AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection is presented. According to real-time measurements, Linux Robot Operation System (ROS) simulates AC electrical machine-specific behavior in case of unbalanced stator currents and notify about possible fault appearance and propagation.

42;DataTime: a Framework to smoothly Integrate Past, Present and Future into Models;"G. Lyan; J. -M. Jézéquel; D. Gross-Amblard; B. Combemale";2021 ACM/IEEE 24th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS);2021.0;Models at runtime have been initially investigated for adaptive systems. Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture.

However, there have been no published works on the use of dual turbine. This paper presents an artificial neural network controller to control Double Differential Gas Turbine (DDGT) by use algorithm to synchronize the speed of two turbines at each variable turbine load to reduce low power balance in the system. From the Rowen's model of control for a turbine, the author analyzed and combined with the existing model to construct a dual turbine combinatorial structure coupled by differential coupling. Model-driven control algorithms are used as training grounds for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace traditional PID controllers. Because the double tubine construction is strong nonlinear system, modeling is directly transformed from the object model. Simulation results for a dual-turbine twin-turbine combination of 32MW, demonstrating the suitability of the theory. Simulation results show that ANN can be deployed into practice to replace PID controllers to increase control accuracy.;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

52;Model-Driven Digital Twin Construction: Synthesizing the Integration of Cyber-Physical Systems with Their Information Systems;Kirchhof JC,Michael J,Rumpe B,Varga S,Wortmann A;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;2020.0;Digital twins emerge in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-physical systems, such as airplanes, cars, factories, medical devices, or ships. There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.;ACM;Conference Paper
53;Understanding and Improving Model-Driven IoT Systems through Accompanying Digital Twins;Kirchhof JC,Malcher L,Rumpe B;Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences;2021.0;Developers questioning why their system behaves differently than expected often have to rely on time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis of log files. Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system’s executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system’s environment based on the data recorded by the system’s digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study. By facilitating the reproduction of the system’s behavior, our method lowers the barrier to understanding the behavior of model-driven IoT systems.;ACM;Conference Paper

We contribute by providing (1) a common understanding of open challenges in research and practice of the engineering of digital twins, and (2) an entry point to researchers who aim to close gaps in the current state of the art.;ACM;Conference Paper
57;Digital Twin as Risk-Free Experimentation Aid for Techno-Socio-Economic Systems;Barat S,Kulkarni V,Clark T,Barn B;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;2022.0;Environmental uncertainties and hyperconnectivity force technosocio-economic systems to introspect and adapt to succeed and survive. Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling & Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss the rigor of our validation of the proposed approach and associated technology infrastructure through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.;ACM;Conference Paper
58;Case Study on Automated and Continuous Reliability Assessment of Software-Defined Manufacturing Based on Digital Twins;Grimmeisen P,Wortmann A,Morozov A;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;Traditional production systems are characterized by rare software updates and fixed production lines. Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-to-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology.In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework.;ACM;Conference Paper
59;TwinOps - DevOps Meets Model-Based Engineering and Digital Twins for the Engineering of CPS;Hugues J,Hristosov A,Hudak JJ,Yankel J;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2020.0;The engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) requires a large set of expertise to capture the system requirements and to derive a correct solution. Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS.In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems. We illustrate our contribution using a Digital Twins case study to illustrate TwinOps benefits, combining AADL and Modelica models, and an IoT platform.;ACM;Conference Paper
60;Using Trace Alignments for Measuring the Similarity between a Physical and Its Digital Twin;Muñoz P,Wimmer M,Troya J,Vallecillo A;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;A common problem in the development of digital twin systems is the validation that the behavior of both twins, the physical and the digital, is the same, or at least similar enough given the requirements of the digital twin system. In this paper, we propose a method for the alignment of the traces of both twins. Traces are sequences of snapshots that capture the progressive states of each entity. Our approach is based on a bioinformatic algorithm that we adapt and use for the alignment of snapshots. Additionally, we include a set of measures to evaluate the quality of these alignments and reason about the level of fidelity of the digital twin system. Two case studies are used to demonstrate our proposal and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.;ACM;Conference Paper
61;Towards a Digital Twin for Cyber-Physical Production Systems: A Multi-Paradigm Modeling Approach in the Postal Industry;Niati A,Selma C,Tamzalit D,Bruneliere H,Mebarki N,Cardin O;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2020.0;This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.;ACM;Conference Paper
62;A Novel Methodology to Construct Digital Twin Models for Spacecraft Operations Using Fault and Behaviour Trees;Christofi N,Pucel X;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;Successful satellite data reception requires the nominal operation of the ground stations in charge of their health monitoring as much as the spacecrafts themselves. Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.;ACM;Conference Paper
63;Reliable Counterparts: Efficiently Testing Causal Relationships in Digital Twins;Somers RJ,Clark AG,Walkinshaw N,Hierons RM;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;The lack of testability of digital twins poses several difficulties when developing reliable systems. Intricate models complicate the definition of comprehensive testing criteria, and physical couplings make obtaining test data an arduous task. To alleviate these challenges, we explore the use of causal inference based testing and propose a technique to allow for correct behaviour of digital twins to be captured in causal diagrams, which are then tested with an efficient data set through the use of counterfactuals. We explore a motivating example of a robotic arm to show how this technique can confirm known causal relationships in a system, and even uncover a fault in the system which caused dangerous behaviour. Our technique localised this erroneous behaviour to a single causal relationship between two variables. Having shown this technique works with a case study, we explore its limitations and the challenges when approaching other industrial applications.;ACM;Conference Paper
64;On the Engineering of IoT-Intensive Digital Twin Software Systems;Rivera LF,Müller HA,Villegas NM,Tamura G,Jiménez M;Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops;2020.0;Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.;ACM;Conference Paper
65;CPSAML: A Language and Code Generation Framework for Digital Twin Based Monitoring of Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems;Fend A,Bork D;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are finding increasing use, whether in factories, autonomous vehicles, or smart buildings. Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots.;ACM;Conference Paper
66;Virtual Soccer Champions: A Case Study on Artifact Reuse in Soccer Robot Digital Twin Construction;Walravens G,Muctadir HM,Cleophas L;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;A Digital Twin (DT) can be described as a pairing of a physical and virtual entity, in which the latter 'mimicks' the former in some sense, using data from its physical counterpart---whether real-time or historical---, for various purposes including better understanding of the physical entity's behaviour, predictive maintenance, and whatif scenario exploration. Here, we focus on the development of the virtual part of the DT in a context where the physical entity already exists, offering the potential for design and engineering artifacts from the physical entity to be reused. We performed a case study on the Turtle soccer robots developed by Eindhoven University of Technology's Tech United [6] team, to explore the possibilities of reusing artifacts for the development of the corresponding virtual entity. In this paper, we present our experiences from this case study and discuss the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges we faced.;ACM;Conference Paper
67;A Flexible and Modular Architecture for Edge Digital Twin: Implementation and Evaluation;Picone M,Mamei M,Zambonelli F;ACM Trans. Internet Things;2023.0;IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) — virtual copies of physical objects and systems — can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.;ACM;Journal Article
68;Enabling Semantic Interoperability of Asset Administration Shells through an Ontology-Based Modeling Method;Huang Y,Dhouib S,Medinacelli LP,Malenfant J;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;Digital twin technology establishes the future development vision for Industry 4.0, and is also an important exploration direction for the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm. Because it builds a more flexible and communicative production system through models that spans life cycle, hierarchy and architecture. The standard proposed under the concept of Industry 4.0, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), provides a syntactic interoperability interface for all assets involved in smart factories. However, there is still a need to fill the gap regarding semantic interoperability, in order to allow efficient interactions between Industry 4.0 components. Ontologies are a good candidate because they provide formal semantics expressed using a knowledge representation language, and in addition, there are many associated mature tools for reasoning and inference. Therefore, we propose a modeling approach that provides semantic interoperability for AAS-based digital twins using ontologies.;ACM;Conference Paper
69;Challenges and Possible Approaches for Sustainable Digital Twinning;Bellis S,Denil J;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;The advance in digital twin technology is creating value for lots of companies. We look at the digital twin design and operation from a sustainability perspective. We identify some challenges related to a digital twin's sustainable design and operation. Finally, we look at some possible approaches, grounded in multi-paradigm modelling to help us create and deploy more sustainable twins.;ACM;Conference Paper
70;Coordination and Explanation of Reconfigurations in Self-Adaptive High-Performance Systems;Stieß S,Becker S,Ege F,Höppner S,Tichy M;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;Self-adaptive systems that modify their architecture to achieve different Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are becoming well-established parts of a company's portfolio. Current systems however do a poor job of coordinating the underlying rules and explaining the system's behavior to developers. This negatively impacts a system's performance due to behaving in unintended and hard-to-comprehend ways.In this vision paper, we introduce an approach that intends to alleviate these problems, for the use-case of high-performance cloud clusters, through the use of a cyber-cyber digital twin based on the Palladio ecosystem. The conceived digital twin allows for several functions that are unexplored in literature so far: the combination of design time analysis with explainability, use of state-space prediction bounded by likelihood, and explanation of non-applicability. This is achieved through a digital twin performing three main activities:1) The predicting activity predicts system performance along several potential paths.2) The planning activity analyzes reconfiguration rules and predicted system behavior to produce reconfiguration plans that try to optimally utilize available resources and achieve all SLOs without unintended interactions between the execution of rules.3) The explaining activity processes all artifacts produced during system simulation time or runtime to provide comprehensive visualizations to developers.We explain how each activity is performed and what models it processes and produces based on a running example.;ACM;Conference Paper
71;Digital Behavioral Twins for Safe Connected Cars;Chen X,Kang E,Shiraishi S,Preciado VM,Jiang Z;Proceedings of the 21th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;2018.0;Driving is a social activity which involves endless interactions with other agents on the road. Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis. We also demonstrate that our digital twins framework can accurately predict driver behaviors and effectively prevent collisions using a case study in a virtual driving simulation environment.;ACM;Conference Paper
72;Classification and Mapping of Layout Algorithms for Usage in Graph-like Modeling Languages;Wrobel G,Scheffler R;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;2022.0;Graph-lik>modeling languages (GLML) are important modeling artifacts for software tools that are used in the environment of software and systems engineering, digital twins, and domain-specific modeling. Just as with textual languages, the concrete syntax is the representation of the language elements intended for humans and thus has a decisive influence on the comprehensibility and usability of the language.The concrete syntax of GLML is often defined less precisely or in less detail when designing metamodels. While metamodels can be designed independently or even without concrete syntax, the latter is required for the actual usage of a graphical language. The layout and the interaction support for editing the language elements are commonly delegated to tool development. However, the development of modeling tools focuses on functionality such as model transformation and model execution, disregarding usability and handling. Low user acceptance then leads to niche applications and a limited number of users. The main reason for the lack of support for laying out and editing the language elements are complex integration challenges mainly concerning the development or adaptation of suitable layout procedures for GLML.Some frameworks offer a remedy by providing layout procedures for GLML. However, GLML differ from each other concerning their concrete syntax. Even minor differences in the concrete syntax of two languages can make the desirransferable or only transferable through complex adaptations. Formal methods for matching the concrete syntax of a GLML with existing layout procedures as early as during the development of the language are missing.In this paper, we present a classification scheme for layout procedures for GLML. The classification scheme is based on a classification scheme we developed for the concrete syntax of GLML, and it contains significant features. We define a mapping procedure between the two classifiers. As a result, the mapping decides whether a layout procedure can be used for a GLML. Both the classification scheme and the process of mapping are demonstrated in a real-world example of a technical graphical domain-specific modeling language.The presented approach supports the design of GLML and the tool development for GLML. It can be an important step towards automated tool development.;ACM;Conference Paper
73;Integration of SysML Models in a 3D Environment for Virtual Testing and Validation;Barosan I,van der Heijden J;Proceedings of the Federated Africa and Middle East Conference on Software Engineering;2022.0;Model–Driven Systems Engineering has been presented as a promising approach for developing complex systems. To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system’s development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.;ACM;Conference Paper
