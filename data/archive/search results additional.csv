Air Quality Management: An Exemplar for Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"H. S. Govindasamy; R. Jayaraman; B. Taspinar; D. Lehner; M. Wimmer";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Since its first mentioning in the literature, the concept of Digital Twin has gained traction in both industry and academia. However, there are still many open challenges when applying Digital Twins to industry-scale use cases. Applying Model-Driven Engineering techniques to the creation and maintenance of Digital Twins (also referred to as Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering) promises automation and consistency throughout the life cycle of a Digital Twin. The exemplar provided in this paper can be used to identify open challenges when it comes to Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering, and to demonstrate how approaches can solve them. This exemplar applies Digital Twins to an indoor air quality management use case, where CO2, temperature, and humidity values of rooms within a building are measured. These values can be used to derive actions to improve work productivity and reduce the risk for virus infections. We describe three applications that make use of this Digital Twin (i.e., runtime visualization, physical simulation, and ML-based predictions), and provide an online repository with the artefacts of this exemplar.
The Research of Aero-engine Digital Twin Model Based on Model-driven and Data-driven Fusion Method;2021 IEEE 10th Data Driven Control and Learning Systems Conference (DDCLS);"K. Liu; P. Wang; Q. Li";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;With the rapid development of multi-field physical modeling, sensor network, big data processing and analysis and other information technologies, digital twin technology is gradually applied in the field of complex equipment operation and maintenance. Aero-engine is a typical complex equipment. The accurate monitoring in operation and performance degradation assessment and prediction are the key problems in maintenance. According to the definition of digital, the paper puts forward the concept of aero-engine digital twin and constructs an aero-engine digital twin model based on precise physical models, historical data and sensors data. The aero-engine digital twin model can predict the physical properties and can be applied to accurate monitoring in operation and performance degradation assessment and prediction.
Generative and Model-driven SDK development for the Industrie 4.0 Digital Twin;2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );"N. Braunisch; M. Ristin-Kaufmann; R. Lehmann; H. W. van de Venn";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Industrie 4.0 maps the digital twin as the Asset Administration Shell. To develop this digital twin, the Asset Administration Shell meta-model is used. A developer needs high-quality libraries in their programming languages to build the Asset Administration Shell in efficient and ergonomic way. The existing representations of the meta-model are inconvenient for moving from the specification to realizations in software development. This leads to many, often manual, re-implementations of the Asset Administration Shell in each programming language. We present an approach to automatically generate libraries based on the intermediate representation of the meta-model. The approach allows for practical and simple development process of Industrie 4.0 components, and scales across programming environments and future changes in the meta-model.
Towards a Reference Architecture for Leveraging Model Repositories for Digital Twins;2020 25th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);"D. Lehner; S. Wolny; A. Mazak-Huemer; M. Wimmer";2020.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;"In the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the degree of complexity continuously increases mainly due to new key-enabling technologies supporting those systems. One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS?s behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models"" are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case."
Digital Twin Operational Platform for Connectivity and Accessibility using Flask Python;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"M. S. Bonney; M. de Angelis; D. Wagg; M. D. Borgo";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;This paper demonstrates an example of an open-source, modular, and system independent framework that has been developed by a team of researchers working for the UK based DigiTwin project. The example in this paper is based on a framework for a digital twin operational platform (DTOP) that uses Flask Python, and is named DTOP-Cristallo. DTOPCristallo is an operational platform that uses HTML web pages as the interface between the digital twin simulations, both python based and 3rd party software based, and the user. This framework is particularly useful for connectivity with users, since it can deploy the digital twin with multiple accessibility options to accommodate a wide variety of intended uses.
An EV-Traction Inverter Data-Driven Modelling for Digital Twin Development;2023 23rd International Scientific Conference on Electric Power Engineering (EPE);"M. Ibrahim; H. A. Raja; A. Rassälkin; T. Vaimann; A. Kallaste";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Digital Twin (DT) technology has achieved a significant breakthrough in the development of numerous applications, including electric vehicles (EVs). This technique involves the creation of a virtual version of a real object, utilizing simulation and optimization tools with real data to optimize its functioning. The traction inverter is considered the brain of the EV drive system, as it controls the power flow between the battery and the electric motor. It converts the DC voltage from the battery into AC voltage and adjusts the frequency and amplitude to control the speed and torque of the motor. This research work presents the DT modelling procedures of an EV traction inverter. The basic principles of DT are discussed, and the model-driven DT modelling technique is compared to the data-driven. The motor-drive physical model (test bench) is provided. A data-driven model of the inverter was generated using a nonlinear regression-based artificial neural network ANN. Historical data from experimental tests were used as a modeling reference. The obtained results from the data-driven model achieved high prediction accuracy.
Inference of Simulation Models in Digital Twins by Reinforcement Learning;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"I. David; J. Galasso; E. Syriani";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;"The typical optimization and control activities of Digital Twins are driven by high-performance simulators. Due to the significant complexity of systems subject to digital twinning, constructing simulators of appropriate details is a costly and error-prone endeavor. To alleviate these problems, we propose an approach for inferring simulation models of Digital Twins by machine learning. Instead of learning the simulation model of one specific simulator, we aim at learning their construction process. This generality enables reusing the inferred knowledge in different (but congruent) Digital Twin settings. To achieve this level of generality, we propose the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism for capturing simulation models; and reinforcement learning (RL) for inferring DEVS models. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges in combining these two techniques."
Data- and model-driven digital twins for design and logistics control of product distribution;2021 23rd International Conference on Control Systems and Computer Science (CSCS);"M. Stan; T. Borangiu; S. R?ileanu";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Digital control of product-on-pallet distribution is organized on two layers in logistics systems: the low-level local process automation and the supervision and coordination dual logistic execution system. The paper's scientific contribution consists in a holonic control system for multiple robot palletizing cells for product-on-pallet distribution. In this holonic control approach, data-driven digital twins (DT) are created to optimize palletizing schedules, controlled with situation awareness and resource health monitoring. A model-driven DT configuration with embedded simulation faster than real-time is combined with the data-driven DT in a meta-level control scheme offering predictive situation awareness. The paper also presents a pure model-driven DT mock-up of a robot palletizing cell - simulation with software in the loop - in which the actual holonic control system including digital twins and decision making is used in the simulation as it will be deployed in reality. This configuration is used to design the robot palletizing cells, to experiment in limit conditions, to fine tune and validate the robot control solution.
Using Ptolemy II as a Framework for Virtual Entity Integration and Orchestration in Digital Twins;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"D. A. M. Negrin; L. Cleophas; M. Van Den Brand";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;The concept of Digital Twin (DT) is increasingly getting attention due to its support for digital transformation as part of Industry 4.0. A core component of a DT is the virtual entity (VE) that is meant to ?mirror? the physical entity (PE). A particular challenge for developing this VE is the integration between the different models that typically make up such a VE. These models, covering different disciplines or aspects of a system, commonly are developed by different engineers and expressed in different formalisms given their strengths and weaknesses. This makes integration between these models and formalisms a challenge. Such integration has two aspects: the communication among the models, and their orchestration, which concerns the order of model step execution and data exchange. In this paper, we consider the suitability of Ptolemy II, an open source framework based on an actor-oriented structure, to implement such integration. We use the Ptolemy II framework to reproduce the implementation of a DT of an autonomous scaled-down truck, which originally required a more manual configuration and execution and was developed in a monolithic way. The results show that Ptolemy II can be used to implement different communication technologies as actors, and show the expressiveness of the orchestrators by reproducing the existing DT?s behavior. This shows Ptolemy II in principle to be suitable as an integration and orchestration tool for models in the context of DTs. As future work, we plan to apply the framework to more complex DTs using different communication technologies, so as to validate its broader suitability for VE orchestration in DTs.
A software engineering point of view on digital twin architecture;2022 IEEE 27th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA);"G. Bchu; A. Beugnard; C. G. L. Cao; Q. Perez; C. Urtado; S. Vauttier";2022.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Digital twins, along with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, have been identified as one of the key technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the definition of Digital Twin (DT) is still abstract and context-dependent. In this paper, we present a metamodel that supports concrete and operational descriptions of digital twin deployment. This metamodel encompasses the different aspects of deployment, including the definition of hardware and software components that compose the layered cyber-physical architectures of the digital twin, along with the installation and instantiation tasks that compose deployment processes. Multiple configurations can also be defined to support the deployment of a digital twin in different execution contexts. The relevance of this metamodel was evaluated by two case studies. The first consists in deploying the digital twin of a cobot in a simulation environment. The second applies the approach in a home automation environment. In both cases, our metamodel provides complete and precise descriptions of the deployment process and thus constitutes a viable first step towards a model-driven approach for digital twin deployment.
Analysis of digital twin application of urban rail power supply system for energy saving;2021 IEEE 1st International Conference on Digital Twins and Parallel Intelligence (DTPI);"Y. Wang; G. Zhang; R. Chen; Z. Liu; R. Qiu";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Energy saving analysis and control of urban rail traction power supply system are usually based on the traditional model driven method. However, due to the shortcomings of ideal conditions, off-line modeling and single mechanism, the traditional model driven method greatly limits the accuracy and timeliness of the model, which is difficult to assist operation and can only be applied to the design stage. As the representative of modern intelligent high-precision modeling and simulation methods, Digital Twin (DT) integrates many advanced technologies, such as Internet of things, high-speed communication, big data analysis and intelligent algorithm, which can fundamentally solve the inherent defects of traditional models. In this paper, the demand of traction power supply system for DT technology was analyzed, and the application mode of DT in energy saving was explored comprehensively. According to the actual characteristics of urban rail transit system, a DT architecture was proposed, and the key technologies of multiphysics modeling and data-driven was analyzed. DT of traction power supply system of urban rail transit will improve the real-time and effectiveness of energy-saving comprehensive analysis and control.
Digital Twins for Sustainable Software Systems;2023 IEEE/ACM 7th International Workshop on Green And Sustainable Software (GREENS);"M. Heithoff; A. Hellwig; J. Michael; B. Rumpe";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Sustainable software systems aim to create resource-efficient software products and reduce the carbon impact of applications. Current approaches for sustainability assessment of software are either only focused on their operation or rely on methods in their engineering. More holistic approaches for sustainable software system spanning are missing. Thus, we are interested in the engineering of sustainable software systems together with the monitoring of their sustainability goals over their whole lifetime. Within this paper, we suggest using digital twins to accompany software systems in all life cycle phases with a specific focus on using model-driven engineering methods for the creation of applications. We can generate accompanying digital twins which share relevant models and data with the actual system and provide services for the assessment of sustainability indicators. In the long run, this provides us with better assessment options for software systems.
Process Prediction with Digital Twins;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"T. Brockhoff; M. Heithoff; I. Koren; J. Michael; J. Pfeiffer; B. Rumpe; M. S. Uysal; W. M. P. Van Der Aalst; A. Wortmann";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Process discovery from event logs as well as process prediction using process models at runtime are increasingly important aspects to improve the operation of digital twins of complex systems. The integration of process mining functionalities with model-driven digital twin architectures raises the question which models are important for the model-driven engineering of digital twins at designtime and at runtime. Currently, research on process mining and model-driven digital twins is conducted in different research communities. Within this position paper, we motivate the need for the holistic combination of both research directions to facilitate harnessing the data and the models of the systems of the future at runtime. The presented position is based upon continuous discussions, workshops, and joint research between process mining experts and software engineering experts in the Internet of Production excellence cluster. We aim to motivate further joint research into the combination of process mining techniques with model-driven digital twins to efficiently combine data and models at runtime.
AML4DT: A Model-Driven Framework for Developing and Maintaining Digital Twins with AutomationML;2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );"D. Lehner; S. Sint; M. Vierhauser; W. Narzt; M. Wimmer";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;As technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming ubiquitous, systems adopting these technologies are getting increasingly complex. Digital Twins (DTs) provide comprehensive views on such systems, the data they generate during runtime, as well as their usage and evolution over time. Setting up the required infrastructure to run a Digital Twin is still an ambitious task that involves significant upfront efforts from domain experts, although existing knowledge about the systems, such as engineering models, may be already available for reuse. To address this issue, we present AML4DT, a model-driven framework supporting the development and maintenance of Digital Twin infrastructures by employing AutomationML (AML) models. We automatically establish a connection between systems and their DTs based on dedicated DT models. These DT models are automatically derived from existing AutomationML models, which are produced in the engineering phases of a system. Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases. A case study shows the benefits of developing and maintaining DTs based on AutomationML models using the proposed AML4DT framework. For this particular study, the effort of performing the required tasks could be reduced by about 50%.
Twin Process Model Driven Machining Quality Optimization for Complex Parts;2021 International Conference on Digital Society and Intelligent Systems (DSInS);"J. Li; G. Zhou; C. Zhang";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Machining process of complex parts is high-performance processing with equal emphasis on geometric accuracy and physical performance indicators, and its machining quality directly affects service performance. Process optimization based on digital twin is considered as an intelligent method to link machining process and process design, which is benefit to the scientific control of machining quality. This paper summarizes the evolution and development of process model and proposes twin process model, which could support the machining quality optimization of complex parts. What?s more, industrial application of twin process model is introduced through three steps, namely mapping relationship between machine operation data and instruction domain, simulation and monitoring of machining surface roughness, and optimization of machining parameter based on twin process model. Finally, the proposed twin process model could provide theoretical support for machining quality control.
Concept of a Modular and System Model Driven Digital Twin for Engineering Education;2023 18th Annual System of Systems Engineering Conference (SoSe);"F. Wilking; M. Behringer; M. Fett; S. Goetz; E. Kirchner; S. Wartzack";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Driven by the opportunities for condition monitoring and new business models, Digital Twins have become a popular topic within research and industrial application over the last years. Therefore, universities must integrate the development of Digital Twins into their educational program to enable future engineers to overcome the challenges concomitant with Digital Twins. While a theoretical basis for Digital Twins is crucial e.g., hardware-software integration, Internet of Things (IoT) or simulation models, a practical combination of these heterogeneous components is also necessary to introduce the Digital Twin as a whole concept. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) an approach was introduced to grasp complexity by using system models e.g., through SysML diagrams. Digital Twins are an example for advanced systems shaped by high complexity. The usage of system models is therefore likely. With this contribution, a concept is presented to combine system models and Digital Twins to create a prototype for academic education and the conduction of student projects.
Integration Challenges for Digital Twin Systems-of-Systems;2022 IEEE/ACM 10th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems (SESoS);"J. Michael; J. Pfeiffer; B. Rumpe; A. Wortmann";2022.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Research and industry leverage digital twins to monitor and control (cyber-physical) systems in various domains. For their efficient engineering, these twins need to become Systems-of-Systems (SoS), in which digital twins of smaller systems (e.g., a production machine) become parts of digital twins of larger systems (e.g., a factory). Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS. These insights may guide future research on engineering digital twins as well as practitioners considering the challenges in building and composing digital twin systems-of-systems.
Models Meet Data: Challenges to Create Virtual Entities for Digital Twins;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"M. Van Den Brand; L. Cleophas; R. Gunasekaran; B. Haverkort; D. A. M. Negrin; H. M. Muctadir";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;In recent years, digital twin (DT) technology has moved to the center of attention of many researchers and engineers. Commonly, a digital twin is defined based on a virtual entity (VE) that exhibits similar behavior to its physical counterpart, and that is coupled to this physical entity (PE). The VE thus forms a core part of any digital twin. While VEs may differ vastly?from ones based on simple simulation to high-fidelity virtual mirroring of the corresponding PE?they are typically composed of multiple models that may originate from multiple domains, address different aspects, and are expressed and processed using different tools and languages. Furthermore, the use of time series data?whether historical or real-time or both?from the PE distinguishes VEs from mere simulations. As a consequence of the modeling landscape complexity and the data aspect of VEs, the design of a digital twin and specifically of the VE as part of it represents several challenges. In this paper, we present our vision for the development, evolution, maintenance, and verification of such virtual entities for digital twins.
Multisource Model-Driven Digital Twin System of Robotic Assembly;IEEE Systems Journal;"X. Li; B. He; Y. Zhou; G. Li";2021.0;IEEE Journals;IEEE;"The digital twin technology effectively fuels improvements in the quality and efficiency of robotic assembly, especially for sophisticated processes. High-quality digitalization requires a comprehensive description and real-time rendering of system, which are challenging. This article aims to demonstrate a novel multisource model-driven digital twin system, which is based on the geometric, physics, and sequential rule descriptions for producing a precise and real-time simulation of a robotic assembly system. In our system, the digital counterpart rendered with virtual reality technology is created and updated by the real environment information. A 3-D graphic model is reconstructed first using the geometric information of surroundings captured by the depth sensor. During interaction, a fast and efficient approach is proposed to generate the contact force and render the object deformation in the virtual environment. The virtual space also provides the sequential rule that is based on the danger field, which helps to constrain the operation of digital twin. At last, the experimental platform is established in which the virtual space is at an update rate of 100 Hz, while the automatic sorting task is performed and verified; the results show the effectiveness and applicability of the method to digital twin system."
Semantic Interoperability of Digital Twins: Ontology-based Capability Checking in AAS Modeling Framework;2023 IEEE 6th International Conference on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS);"Y. Huang; S. Dhouib; L. P. Medinacelli; J. Malenfant";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Industry 4.0 currently prepares a major shift towards extreme flexibility into production lines management. Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the ?Papyrus for Manufacturing? toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning. This paper showcases this approach through a robotic cell use case.
A Lightweight Model-driven MES Simulation Framework Based On Probabilistic Finite Automata;2022 7th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing (ICSP);"K. Zhang; J. Tian; J. Han; Q. Yuan";2022.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;"In recent years, the concept of digital twin was introduced to the field of intelligent manufacturing. People use simulation technologies to complete the process of physical equipment in virtual space. As the manager of production process data, MES system is an important basis of digital twin in industrial production. Current MES systems are mostly developed for specific domains, often for large enterprises, with high coupling and poor scalability, which are difficult to be applied to smaller production enterprises with low informationization degree. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model-driven MES simulation framework that uses probabilistic finite automata to form a fast modeling for factory as well as to generate production data, and achieves a highly flexible production process simulation through config files; the framework could also be used to build a real MES system for small and medium-sized production enterprises."

Dynamic Runtime Integration of New Models in Digital Twins;2023 IEEE/ACM 18th Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS);"H. Ejersbo; K. Lausdahl; M. Frasheri; L. Esterle";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;The development of cyber-physical systems is heavily relying on model-driven approaches. After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.

Sahoo; S. Sahithi; J. Channegowda";2022.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Electric Vehicle numbers have rapidly increased over the past decade. There is a dire need to establish accurate simulation frameworks to model the Electric Vehicle performance. Multiple simulation model-based approaches have been proposed in literature which consider the impact of various drive cycles on vehicle characteristics. All the available Electric Vehicle simulation models available in literature use lumped battery parameters which do not capture the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle. A detailed battery model considering drive cycle dynamics In Electric Vehicle Digital Twins have not been explored by researchers. This paper aims to provide tangible EV performance characteristics accounting for detailed 2RC battery model. This paper has used a two wheeler drive characteristics driven by a 2 kW Brushless Direct Current Motor powered by a 3.2 kWh battery pack. This paper also compares the variations in battery parameters with the lumped battery model to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach.

Based on the physical production line model of the digital twin, the virtual and real joint debugging method of the digital twin workshop is constructed: the controller controls the virtual model, and the virtual model drives the simulation. The operation and control model of the digital twin is driven through the communication framework of OPC UA (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Unified Architecture), and the virtual and real interaction of the physical production line is used to timely reflect the operation of the workshop. From model building, model digital drive, virtual and real control joint debugging, to full life cycle workshop verification and design simulation, the visual monitoring of the digital twin workshop is finally realized.
Using UML and OCL Models to Realize High-Level Digital Twins;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"P. Mu¤oz; J. Troya; A. Vallecillo";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Digital twins constitute virtual representations of physically existing systems. However, their inherent complexity makes them difficult to develop and prove correct. In this paper we explore the use of UML and OCL, complemented with an executable language, SOIL, to build and test digital twins at a high level of abstraction. We also show how to realize the bidirectional connection between the UML models of the digital twin in the USE tool with the physical twin, using an architectural framework centered on a data lake. We have built a prototype of the framework to demonstrate our ideas, and validated it by developing a digital twin of a Lego Mindstorms car. The results allow us to show some interesting advantages of using high-level UML models to specify virtual twins, such as simulation, property checking and some other types of tests.

A Model-Driven Approach for Situational Intelligence & Operational Awareness;2019 Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference Europe (PCIC EUROPE);"S. Shokooh; G. Nordvik";2019.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;In order to design, operate, and maintain an oil and gas facility, one must first understand its behavior. A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely. Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a ?digital twin? of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system. A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation. This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.
Knowledge driven rapid development of white box digital twins for industrial plant systems;IECON 2021 ? 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;"A. B.; S. R.C.; B. B.; R. Dhakshinamoorthy; S. A.; N. S.";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Industrial systems like power plants need a significant domain and engineering expertise for their efficient operations. Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture. Our approach to developing a DT supporting a fault management scenario in a power plant reduced 70% development time and 50% manual efforts.
Interface Management with Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE);2018 IEEE International Systems Engineering Symposium (ISSE);"M. Di Maio; L. Atorf; U. Dahmen; M. Schluse; J. Rossmann; M. Hoppe; G. -D. Kapos";2018.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Interfaces (IF) and their Management (IFM) are a particular challenge in the successful development of complex products and products operating in a complex environment. In Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE) IFM is fully integrated into its Model-Driven Engineering Process (MDEP). CLOSE provides fully automated IF modelling, traceable IF history, an efficient handling of IF negotiations and the effective de-coupling of interfacing systems. Especially in combination with CLOSE's Experimentable Digital Twins (EDTs), IFM becomes a vital resource for the development process, rather than the parallel process it so often is today, supporting early variant evaluation, balance checks and impact analysis, which makes it a central asset for developing better products. This paper describes IFM in CLOSE and illustrates it with a case study of a Martian robot for autonomous scientific missions.
Prediction Study of the Heavy Vehicle Driving State Based on Digital Twin Model;2021 IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Computer Applications (ICPECA);"J. Liu; Y. Dong; Y. Liu; P. Li; S. Liu; T. Wang";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;"In order to study the driving state of heavy vehicles, two approaches are employed hereby to establish digital twin models for analyzing the applicable scopes of the models and conducting a predictive study. To begin with, the operating parameters and the state of the vehicles are measured using instruments and apparatuses. Then, relying on a GP and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), two digital twin models of vehicles driving state are established, respectively, which set the transmission system and power system parameters as well as weather conditions as input parameters; and vehicle running speed and torque value as output ones. Both digital twin models consider the physical rule of the vehicle to avoid overfitting in the training. The analytical results indicate that the GP-based digital twin model appears more accurate in predicting the driving parameters of the vehicles, whereas the model based on the DCNN has better convergence precision within a short span of time. The vehicle-specific digital twin models set up in this paper lay a foundation for subsequent optimization of vehicle driving state and realization of digital twin-physical entity interaction."

In particular, UI provides a set of candidate policies in complex scenarios, and supports policy makers and stakeholders in designing shared, evidence-based, and integrated solutions. UI is being applied for the first time to two Italian cities, Matera and Catania, paving the way for a deeper scientific framing of the paradigm, as well as for the technological development and testing of the core UI ecosystem in real-life situations. The paper introduces the UI key-concepts and components, illustrates the ongoing experimentations in these pilot cities related to the development of two DTs on parts of the urban areas, and presents some initial results.
Developing a Physical and Digital Twin: An Example Process Model;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"H. Feng; C. Gomes; M. Sandberg; C. Thule; K. Lausdahl; P. G. Larsen";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;As a result of the fast development of technologies and diversity of requirements, complexity exists not only in a system itself but also in the development process and environment. The complexity in the development process comes from specialization and concurrency, and a Digital Twin (DT) has the potential to mitigate these issues. We hope, during the process of building a DT, the accidental complexity can be minimized by application of model-based systems engineering and the Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM). In this paper, we give an example of the process of building a DT combined with a process model. Our long term goal is to model the development of various DTs to identify the commonalities and variations across multiple DTs.
A Methodology for Digital Twin Modeling and Deployment for Industry 4.0;Proceedings of the IEEE;"G. N. Schroeder; C. Steinmetz; R. N. Rodrigues; R. V. B. Henriques; A. Rettberg; C. E. Pereira";2021.0;IEEE Journals;IEEE;"The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT."
Combining Low-Code Programming and SDL-Based Modeling with Snap! in the Industry 4.0 Context;2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);"X. P. i. Paloms; P. Tuset-Peir¢; P. F. i. Casas";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;One of the main challenges to implement Industry 4.0 technologies within the industrial fabric is the lack of suitable concrete models and tools that demonstrate the potential benefits of embracing the digital transformation process. To overcome this challenge, over the past years, various Industry 4.0 automation and robotics providers have presented solutions based on visual block programming languages, which follow an emerging low-code approach to reduce the entry barriers of digital technologies. However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap! to create SDL4Snap!, an open-source and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes. Overall, the resulting tool has the potential to reduce the entry barrier to Digital Twins in small and medium enterprises, which are part of the late majority and laggard groups regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0.
Digital Twins Driving Model Based on Petri Net in Industrial Pipeline;2020 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Electromechanical Automation (AIEA);"Y. Dai; Y. Shi; Z. Zhang; R. Tao; F. Fang";2020.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Online simulation systems are mostly model-driven without considering about real-time interactive controlling with physical systems. In order to enhance the two-way interaction control capability of digital twins and physical systems, this paper proposes a digital twin-driven model based on Petri Net. It defines a state incremental update place for enhancing the ability of real-time simulation, and defines a feedback control structure to control the function of opening and closing the real industrial pipelines. Taking the industrial parameters of the suit processing line as experimental data, the feasibility of online synchronization communication and feedback control of the digital twin driven model and the actual production line was verified.

Automated Model Transformation in modeling Digital Twins of Industrial Internet-of-Things Applications utilizing AutomationML;2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );"C. Binder; A. Cal; J. Vollmar; C. Neureiter; A. Lder";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;In recent years, the manufacturing industry sector has undergone major changes. Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software. The results of this approach are thereby evaluated by a real-world case study, which is applied according to the concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0).
Digital Twin Service Unit for AC Motor Stator Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Detection;2021 28th International Workshop on Electric Drives: Improving Reliability of Electric Drives (IWED);"V. Rjabt?ikov; A. Rassälkin; B. Asad; T. Vaimann; A. Kallaste; V. Kuts; S. Jegorov; M. St?pie?; M. Krawczyk";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;A modern trend for industry digitalization brings new demands for the development and application of the modeling and simulation approach. It is already not enough to have only a virtual representation of the object and run it independently from the physical object. The Digital Twin (DT) aspect indicates a connection between the physical object and the corresponding virtual twin established by generating real-time data using sensors. The DT represents physical object operation throughout its life cycle, making it an essential tool for improving that object's reliability. In this paper, an application of the DT service unit for AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection is presented. According to real-time measurements, Linux Robot Operation System (ROS) simulates AC electrical machine-specific behavior in case of unbalanced stator currents and notify about possible fault appearance and propagation. Fault, such as discussed in the paper (AC machine stator inter-turn) is considered one of the most prevalent possible electrical motor failure.
Urban Intelligence: a Modular, Fully Integrated, and Evolving Model for Cities Digital Twinning;2019 IEEE 16th International Conference on Smart Cities: Improving Quality of Life Using ICT & IoT and AI (HONET-ICT);"G.

UI provides sets of candidate policies in complex scenarios and supports policy makers and stakeholders in designing sustainable and personalized solutions. The main characteristics of the proposed UI architecture are (a) fully multidisciplinary integration of city layers, (b) connection and evolution with the city, (c) integration of participative strategies to include ?human-oriented? information, and (d) modularity of application.
DataTime: a Framework to smoothly Integrate Past, Present and Future into Models;2021 ACM/IEEE 24th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS);"G. Lyan; J. -M. Jzquel; D. Gross-Amblard; B. Combemale";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Models at runtime have been initially investigated for adaptive systems. Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.
Proof of Concept for a Roundtrip Engineering IS for the New Enterprise in the Industry 4.0 Era;2022 24th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC);"A. Chi?; A. -M. Ghiran; R. A. Buchmann";2022.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Traditionally, enterprises had relied on information systems (IS) as a medium to represent reality, but recently, there is a growing trend among IS scholars admitting that contemporary environment is calling for a change in the view about the IS' implications in our lives. They acknowledge that our world is increasingly shaped by what is created and performed in various digital environments. In this view, we ask how conceptual modelling (as a particular manifestation of IS) could be used to shape this new environment while continue being used as a means to represent the domain of discourse. This work at hand presents a proof-of-concept for the new enterprise systems where conceptual modelling plays a key role and the modelling tool acts as a transition layer between physical and digital realities.
AAS Capability-Based Operation and Engineering of Flexible Production Lines;2021 26th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA );"Y. Huang; S. Dhouib; J. Malenfant";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;"Lot-size-one systems as well as plug and produce concepts imply (1) producing increased variety of products in a highly flexible and timely manner, and (2) making commissioning and maintenance more flexible. The speed with which manufacturers, in particular SMEs, can reconfigure the production to a new run and thus respond to clients and avoid costly machine downtime is critical to maintaining commercial success and profit margins. The manufacturing systems of tomorrow must offer a high degree of autonomy, be quickly re-planned to other operations, and cope with a wide variety of unforeseen situations, in a secure and safe manner. In this context, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emergent standard that leverages the digital twin approach and provides concepts for describing capabilities and skills of I4.0 components in order to automate the reconfiguration process. This article proposes a capability-based operation and engineering approach to tackle the syntactic and semantic interoperability problems in flexible production lines. We demonstrate the implementation of the AAS standard in the open source model-driven workbench Papyrus; then we assess its usability for modeling a production cell use case in order to implement a capability-based reconfiguration approach for flexible production lines."
An AAS Modeling Tool for Capability-Based Engineering of Flexible Production Lines;IECON 2021 ? 47th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society;"Y. Huang; S. Dhouib; J. Malenfant";2021.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;The future intelligent manufacturing systems should possess a high degree of autonomy, which is able to monitor the entire production process, quickly re-plan operations, and respond to various unforeseen situations in a secure and safe manner. This can achieve rapid response to customers and avoid costly machine downtime, which is crucial to maintaining business success and profitability. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emerging standard in the I4.0 (Industry 4.0) domain. Based on the concept of digital twins, it provides concepts for describing the digital representation of I4.0 assets including their capabilities and skills. The AAS provides also responses to the challenge of syntactic and semantic interoperability that the flexible and autonomous production lines are facing. In this article, we propose a capability-based operation and engineering approach for flexible production lines. Our approach is relying on the AAS standard which is a very wide and rich specification. Consequently, we describe the subset of AAS modelling concepts necessary for our approach, we clarify their semantics and we show their usage through a production cell use case. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these modelling concepts were tooled as an extension of the open source model-driven workbench Papyrus.
Learning to Predict and Optimize Imperfect MIMO System Performance: Framework and Application;GLOBECOM 2022 - 2022 IEEE Global Communications Conference;"J. Su; F. Meng; S. Liu; Y. Huang; Z. Lu";2022.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;In imperfect multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, model-based methods for performance prediction and optimization generally experience degradation in the dynamically changing environment with unknown interference and uncertain channel state information (CSI). To adapt to such challenging settings and better accomplish the network auto-tuning tasks, we propose a generic learnable model-driven framework. We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results.
Holistic Network Virtualization and Pervasive Network Intelligence for 6G;IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials;"X. Shen; J. Gao; W. Wu; M. Li; C. Zhou; W. Zhuang";2022.0;IEEE Journals;IEEE;In this tutorial paper, we look into the evolution and prospect of network architecture and propose a novel conceptual architecture for the 6th generation (6G) networks. The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and developments on the potential architecture of 6G.
A neural control of the parallel Gas Turbine with differential link;2017 International Conference on System Science and Engineering (ICSSE);Nguyen Hoang Mai;2017.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Gas turbine engine has the highest performance in the engine rotation. The performance of the types of modern gas turbines could able up to 44%. In specific applications, gas turbines are used for equipment such as electrical generators, aircraft engines, high-speed boat ? The applications of gas turbine are used to transmit turbine, cabinet pull in eneral[3],[5],[6],[9],[10],[12],[15]. However, there have been no published works on the use of dual turbine. This paper presents an artificial neural network controller to control Double Differential Gas Turbine (DDGT) by use algorithm to synchronize the speed of two turbines at each variable turbine load to reduce low power balance in the system. From the Rowen's model of control for a turbine, the author analyzed and combined with the existing model to construct a dual turbine combinatorial structure coupled by differential coupling. Model-driven control algorithms are used as training grounds for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace traditional PID controllers. Because the double tubine construction is strong nonlinear system, modeling is directly transformed from the object model. Simulation results for a dual-turbine twin-turbine combination of 32MW, demonstrating the suitability of the theory. Simulation results show that ANN can be deployed into practice to replace PID controllers to increase control accuracy.

Model-Driven Digital Twin Construction: Synthesizing the Integration of Cyber-Physical Systems with Their Information Systems;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;Kirchhof JC,Michael J,Rumpe B,Varga S,Wortmann A;2020.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Digital twins emerge in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-physical systems, such as airplanes, cars, factories, medical devices, or ships. There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.
Understanding and Improving Model-Driven IoT Systems through Accompanying Digital Twins;Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts and Experiences;Kirchhof JC,Malcher L,Rumpe B;2021.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Developers questioning why their system behaves differently than expected often have to rely on time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis of log files. Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system?s executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system?s environment based on the data recorded by the system?s digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study. By facilitating the reproduction of the system?s behavior, our method lowers the barrier to understanding the behavior of model-driven IoT systems.
How Alike Are My Physical and Digital Twins?;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Mu¤oz P;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;A digital twin is a virtual replica of a system defined at a certain level of fidelity, and synchronized at a specific frequency. Digital twins are often used to replicate physical systems whose simulations are usually computationally costly. One of the solutions proposed in the literature to this problem is to define a hierarchy of multi-fidelity digital twins, where we use one twin or another depending on the specific purpose. However, one of the challenges of this proposal is the need to determine whether these twins are equivalent to each other and the physical system according to their purpose. In this work, we explore different methods to measure this equivalence by analyzing the state and behavior of the twins using high-level software models.

Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling & Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss the rigor of our validation of the proposed approach and associated technology infrastructure through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.
Case Study on Automated and Continuous Reliability Assessment of Software-Defined Manufacturing Based on Digital Twins;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Grimmeisen P,Wortmann A,Morozov A;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Traditional production systems are characterized by rare software updates and fixed production lines. Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-to-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology.In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework.
TwinOps - DevOps Meets Model-Based Engineering and Digital Twins for the Engineering of CPS;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Hugues J,Hristosov A,Hudak JJ,Yankel J;2020.0;Conference Paper;ACM;The engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) requires a large set of expertise to capture the system requirements and to derive a correct solution. Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS.In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems. We illustrate our contribution using a Digital Twins case study to illustrate TwinOps benefits, combining AADL and Modelica models, and an IoT platform.
Using Trace Alignments for Measuring the Similarity between a Physical and Its Digital Twin;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Mu¤oz P,Wimmer M,Troya J,Vallecillo A;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;A common problem in the development of digital twin systems is the validation that the behavior of both twins, the physical and the digital, is the same, or at least similar enough given the requirements of the digital twin system. In this paper, we propose a method for the alignment of the traces of both twins. Traces are sequences of snapshots that capture the progressive states of each entity. Our approach is based on a bioinformatic algorithm that we adapt and use for the alignment of snapshots. Additionally, we include a set of measures to evaluate the quality of these alignments and reason about the level of fidelity of the digital twin system. Two case studies are used to demonstrate our proposal and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.
Towards a Digital Twin for Cyber-Physical Production Systems: A Multi-Paradigm Modeling Approach in the Postal Industry;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Niati A,Selma C,Tamzalit D,Bruneliere H,Mebarki N,Cardin O;2020.0;Conference Paper;ACM;This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.
A Novel Methodology to Construct Digital Twin Models for Spacecraft Operations Using Fault and Behaviour Trees;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Christofi N,Pucel X;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Successful satellite data reception requires the nominal operation of the ground stations in charge of their health monitoring as much as the spacecrafts themselves. Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.
Reliable Counterparts: Efficiently Testing Causal Relationships in Digital Twins;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Somers RJ,Clark AG,Walkinshaw N,Hierons RM;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;The lack of testability of digital twins poses several difficulties when developing reliable systems. Intricate models complicate the definition of comprehensive testing criteria, and physical couplings make obtaining test data an arduous task. To alleviate these challenges, we explore the use of causal inference based testing and propose a technique to allow for correct behaviour of digital twins to be captured in causal diagrams, which are then tested with an efficient data set through the use of counterfactuals. We explore a motivating example of a robotic arm to show how this technique can confirm known causal relationships in a system, and even uncover a fault in the system which caused dangerous behaviour. Our technique localised this erroneous behaviour to a single causal relationship between two variables. Having shown this technique works with a case study, we explore its limitations and the challenges when approaching other industrial applications.
On the Engineering of IoT-Intensive Digital Twin Software Systems;Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops;Rivera LF,Mller HA,Villegas NM,Tamura G,Jimnez M;2020.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart---the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.
CPSAML: A Language and Code Generation Framework for Digital Twin Based Monitoring of Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Fend A,Bork D;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are finding increasing use, whether in factories, autonomous vehicles, or smart buildings. Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots.
Virtual Soccer Champions: A Case Study on Artifact Reuse in Soccer Robot Digital Twin Construction;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Walravens G,Muctadir HM,Cleophas L;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;A Digital Twin (DT) can be described as a pairing of a physical and virtual entity, in which the latter 'mimicks' the former in some sense, using data from its physical counterpart---whether real-time or historical---, for various purposes including better understanding of the physical entity's behaviour, predictive maintenance, and whatif scenario exploration. Here, we focus on the development of the virtual part of the DT in a context where the physical entity already exists, offering the potential for design and engineering artifacts from the physical entity to be reused. We performed a case study on the Turtle soccer robots developed by Eindhoven University of Technology's Tech United [6] team, to explore the possibilities of reusing artifacts for the development of the corresponding virtual entity. In this paper, we present our experiences from this case study and discuss the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges we faced.
A Flexible and Modular Architecture for Edge Digital Twin: Implementation and Evaluation;ACM Trans. Internet Things;Picone M,Mamei M,Zambonelli F;2023.0;Journal Article;ACM;IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) ? virtual copies of physical objects and systems ? can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.
Enabling Semantic Interoperability of Asset Administration Shells through an Ontology-Based Modeling Method;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Huang Y,Dhouib S,Medinacelli LP,Malenfant J;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Digital twin technology establishes the future development vision for Industry 4.0, and is also an important exploration direction for the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm. Because it builds a more flexible and communicative production system through models that spans life cycle, hierarchy and architecture. The standard proposed under the concept of Industry 4.0, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), provides a syntactic interoperability interface for all assets involved in smart factories. However, there is still a need to fill the gap regarding semantic interoperability, in order to allow efficient interactions between Industry 4.0 components. Ontologies are a good candidate because they provide formal semantics expressed using a knowledge representation language, and in addition, there are many associated mature tools for reasoning and inference. Therefore, we propose a modeling approach that provides semantic interoperability for AAS-based digital twins using ontologies.
Challenges and Possible Approaches for Sustainable Digital Twinning;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Bellis S,Denil J;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;The advance in digital twin technology is creating value for lots of companies. We look at the digital twin design and operation from a sustainability perspective. We identify some challenges related to a digital twin's sustainable design and operation. Finally, we look at some possible approaches, grounded in multi-paradigm modelling to help us create and deploy more sustainable twins.
Coordination and Explanation of Reconfigurations in Self-Adaptive High-Performance Systems;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Stieá S,Becker S,Ege F,Hppner S,Tichy M;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Self-adaptive systems that modify their architecture to achieve different Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are becoming well-established parts of a company's portfolio. Current systems however do a poor job of coordinating the underlying rules and explaining the system's behavior to developers. This negatively impacts a system's performance due to behaving in unintended and hard-to-comprehend ways.In this vision paper, we introduce an approach that intends to alleviate these problems, for the use-case of high-performance cloud clusters, through the use of a cyber-cyber digital twin based on the Palladio ecosystem. The conceived digital twin allows for several functions that are unexplored in literature so far: the combination of design time analysis with explainability, use of state-space prediction bounded by likelihood, and explanation of non-applicability. This is achieved through a digital twin performing three main activities:1) The predicting activity predicts system performance along several potential paths.2) The planning activity analyzes reconfiguration rules and predicted system behavior to produce reconfiguration plans that try to optimally utilize available resources and achieve all SLOs without unintended interactions between the execution of rules.3) The explaining activity processes all artifacts produced during system simulation time or runtime to provide comprehensive visualizations to developers.We explain how each activity is performed and what models it processes and produces based on a running example.
Digital Behavioral Twins for Safe Connected Cars;Proceedings of the 21th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;Chen X,Kang E,Shiraishi S,Preciado VM,Jiang Z;2018.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Driving is a social activity which involves endless interactions with other agents on the road. Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis. We also demonstrate that our digital twins framework can accurately predict driver behaviors and effectively prevent collisions using a case study in a virtual driving simulation environment.
Classification and Mapping of Layout Algorithms for Usage in Graph-like Modeling Languages;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Wrobel G,Scheffler R;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Graph-lik>modeling languages (GLML) are important modeling artifacts for software tools that are used in the environment of software and systems engineering, digital twins, and domain-specific modeling. Just as with textual languages, the concrete syntax is the representation of the language elements intended for humans and thus has a decisive influence on the comprehensibility and usability of the language.The concrete syntax of GLML is often defined less precisely or in less detail when designing metamodels. While metamodels can be designed independently or even without concrete syntax, the latter is required for the actual usage of a graphical language. The layout and the interaction support for editing the language elements are commonly delegated to tool development. However, the development of modeling tools focuses on functionality such as model transformation and model execution, disregarding usability and handling. Low user acceptance then leads to niche applications and a limited number of users. The main reason for the lack of support for laying out and editing the language elements are complex integration challenges mainly concerning the development or adaptation of suitable layout procedures for GLML.Some frameworks offer a remedy by providing layout procedures for GLML. However, GLML differ from each other concerning their concrete syntax. Even minor differences in the concrete syntax of two languages can make the desirransferable or only transferable through complex adaptations. Formal methods for matching the concrete syntax of a GLML with existing layout procedures as early as during the development of the language are missing.In this paper, we present a classification scheme for layout procedures for GLML. The classification scheme is based on a classification scheme we developed for the concrete syntax of GLML, and it contains significant features. We define a mapping procedure between the two classifiers. As a result, the mapping decides whether a layout procedure can be used for a GLML. Both the classification scheme and the process of mapping are demonstrated in a real-world example of a technical graphical domain-specific modeling language.The presented approach supports the design of GLML and the tool development for GLML. It can be an important step towards automated tool development.
Integration of SysML Models in a 3D Environment for Virtual Testing and Validation;Proceedings of the Federated Africa and Middle East Conference on Software Engineering;Barosan I,van der Heijden J;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Model?Driven Systems Engineering has been presented as a promising approach for developing complex systems. To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system?s development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.
MoDDiT 2021: 1st International Workshop on Model-Driven Engineering for Digital Twins;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Bordeleau, F; Cleophas, L; Combemale, B; Eramo, R; van den Brand, M; Wimmer, M; Wortmann, A";;C;;Digital twins (DT) are emerging and gaining attention in several disciplines to support different phases of the system life-cycle such as design-space exploration, runtime adaptation, and predictive maintenance of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). The term DT refers to the capability to clone an actual system into a virtual counterpart, that reflects the important properties of the system for a specific purpose. While benefits of DT have been demonstrated in many domains, their development, operation, and evolution, trigger major challenges. Part of these may be addressed from a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) perspective. MoDDiT'21 aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners in the DTs area to shape the future of systematically designing, engineering, evolving, maintaining, and evaluating DTs.
Towards a Model-Driven Architecture for Interactive Digital Twin Cockpits;CONCEPTUAL MODELING, ER 2020;"Dalibor, M; Michael, J; Rumpe, B; Varga, S; Wortmann, A";;C;;Digital twins promise tremendous potential to reduce time and cost in the smart manufacturing of Industry 4.0. Engineering and monitoring interactive digital twins currently demands integrating different piecemeal technologies that effectively hinders their application and deployment. Current research on digital twins focuses on specific implementations or abstract models on how digital twins could be conceived. We propose model-driven software engineering to realize interactive digital twins and user-specific cockpits to interact with the digital twin by generating the infrastructure from common data structure models. To this end, we present a model-driven architecture for digital twins, its integration with an interactive cockpit, and a systematic method of realizing both. Through this, modeling, deploying, and monitoring interactive digital twins becomes more feasible and fosters their successful application in smart manufacturing.
Towards Development Platforms for Digital Twins: A Model-Driven Low-Code Approach;ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, APMS 2021, PT I;"Michael, J; Wortmann, A";;S;;Digital Twins in smart manufacturing must be highly adaptable for different challenges, environments, and system states. In practice, there is a need for enabling the configuration of Digital Twins by domain experts. Low-code approaches seem to be a meaningful solution for configuration purposes but often lack extension options. We propose a model-driven low-code approach for the configuration and reconfiguration of Digital Twins using language plugins. This approach uses model-driven software engineering and software language engineering methods to derive a configurable digital twin implementation. Moreover, we discuss some remaining challenges such as interoperability, language modularity, evolution, integration of assistive services, collaborative development, and web-based debugging.
Process Prediction with Digital Twins;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Brockhoff, T; Heithoff, M; Koren, I; Michael, J; Pfeiffer, J; Rumpe, B; Uysal, MS; Van der Aalst, WMP; Wortmann, A";;C;;Process discovery from event logs as well as process prediction using process models at runtime are increasingly important aspects to improve the operation of digital twins of complex systems. The integration of process mining functionalities with model-driven digital twin architectures raises the question which models are important for the model-driven engineering of digital twins at designtime and at runtime. Currently, research on process mining and model-driven digital twins is conducted in different research communities. Within this position paper, we motivate the need for the holistic combination of both research directions to facilitate harnessing the data and the models of the systems of the future at runtime. The presented position is based upon continuous discussions, workshops, and joint research between process mining experts and software engineering experts in the Internet of Production excellence cluster. We aim to motivate further joint research into the combination of process mining techniques with model-driven digital twins to efficiently combine data and models at runtime.
AML4DT: A Model-Driven Framework for Developing and Maintaining Digital Twins with AutomationML;2021 26TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND FACTORY AUTOMATION (ETFA);"Lehner, D; Sint, S; Vierhauser, M; Narzt, W; Wimmer, M";;C;;As technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming ubiquitous, systems adopting these technologies are getting increasingly complex. Digital Twins (DTs) provide comprehensive views on such systems, the data they generate during runtime, as well as their usage and evolution over time. Setting up the required infrastructure to run a Digital Twin is still an ambitious task that involves significant upfront efforts from domain experts, although existing knowledge about the systems, such as engineering models, may be already available for reuse. To address this issue, we present AML4DT, a model-driven framework supporting the development and maintenance of Digital Twin infrastructures by employing AutomationML (AML) models. We automatically establish a connection between systems and their DTs based on dedicated DT models. These DT models are automatically derived from existing AutomationML models, which are produced in the engineering phases of a system. Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases. A case study shows the benefits of developing and maintaining DTs based on AutomationML models using the proposed AML4DT framework. For this particular study, the effort of performing the required tasks could be reduced by about 50%.

Air Quality Management: An Exemplar for Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Govindasamy, HS; Jayaraman, R; Taspinar, B; Lehner, D; Wimmer, M";;C;;Since its first mentioning in the literature, the concept of Digital Twin has gained traction in both industry and academia. However, there are still many open challenges when applying Digital Twins to industry-scale use cases. Applying Model-Driven Engineering techniques to the creation and maintenance of Digital Twins (also referred to as Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering) promises automation and consistency throughout the life cycle of a Digital Twin. The exemplar provided in this paper can be used to identify open challenges when it comes to Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering, and to demonstrate how approaches can solve them. This exemplar applies Digital Twins to an indoor air quality management use case, where CO2, temperature, and humidity values of rooms within a building are measured. These values can be used to derive actions to improve work productivity and reduce the risk for virus infections. We describe three applications that make use of this Digital Twin (i.e., runtime visualization, physical simulation, and ML-based predictions), and provide an online repository with the artefacts of this exemplar.
Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE): Integrating Experimentable Digital Twins with the Model-Driven Engineering Process;2018 4TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (ISSE);"Di Maio, M; Kapos, GD; Klusmann, N; Atorf, L; Dahmen, U; Schluse, M; Rossmann, J";;C;;A particular problem in the practical application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for the development of complex products is the effective integration of other engineering models. The Model-Driven Engineering Process (MDEP) addresses this by providing clearly defined insert points for domain models and simulation engines. In Closed-Loop Systems Engineering (CLOSE) Experimentable Digital Twins (EDTs) are integrated in the MDEP to realistically simulate how system functions would be executed by physical parts of the developed product. CLOSE thus can reduce the cycle times for analysis, design, development, optimisation, and some of the verification. This paper introduces the basic concept of CLOSE and illustrates its application with a case study.
A MODEL-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR SITUATIONAL INTELLIGENCE & OPERATIONAL AWARENESS;2019 PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CONFERENCE EUROPE (PCIC EUROPE);"Shokooh, S; Nordvik, G";;C;;In order to design, operate, and maintain an oil and gas facility, one must first understand its behavior. A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely. Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a digital twin of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system. A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation. This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.
A framework for Model-Driven Engineering of resilient software-controlled systems;COMPUTING;"Parri, J; Patara, F; Sampietro, S; Vicario, E";;J;;Emergent paradigms of Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things expect cyber-physical systems to reliably provide services overcoming disruptions in operative conditions and adapting to changes in architectural and functional requirements. In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, areflectivearchitecture developed arounddigital twinsenables representation and control of systemConfiguration Itemsproperly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones.
Supporting Digital Twins for the Retrofit in Aviation by a Model-Driven Data Handling;SYSTEMS;"Laukotka, FN; Krause, D";;J;;Aviation is characterized by many stakeholders, long lifespans of its assets, and high requirements regarding safety, security, and documentation. To meet these requirements as well as customer needs, aircraft are regularly retrofitted with new cabins. During the planning and execution of this cabin retrofit, handling the needed and available data poses a challenge to the engineers. While much of the required data is available in some form, generally there is a lack of a digitally usable dataset of the specific aircraft-a virtual representation of the physical asset is missing. To support the implementation of such a digital twin and, thus, the overall process of retrofitting aircraft, an approach to model-driven data handling tailored to the unique circumstances and requirements of aviation is introduced. The methodology consists of a combination of systems engineering and data science techniques framed by an overarching procedure that iteratively creates and enhances a digitally accessible dataset of the relevant data, hence supporting the retrofit engineers by easing access to needed information. Besides the presentation of the research background and the methodology, a simplified example is shown, demonstrating the approach using abstracted but realistic information provided by partners from the industry.
Model-Driven Development of a Digital Twin for Injection Molding;ADVANCED INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, CAISE 2020;"Bibow, P; Dalibor, M; Hopmann, C; Mainz, B; Rumpe, B; Schmalzing, D; Schmitz, M; Wortmann, A";;C;;Digital Twins (DTs) of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) enable the smart automation of production processes, collection of data, and can thus reduce manual efforts for supervising and controlling CPPSs. Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a modeldriven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.
Generative and Model-driven SDK development for the Industrie 4.0 Digital Twin;2021 26TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND FACTORY AUTOMATION (ETFA);"Braunisch, N; Ristin-Kaufmann, M; Lehmann, R; Van de Venn, HW";;C;;Industrie 4.0 maps the digital twin as the Asset Administration Shell. To develop this digital twin, the Asset Administration Shell meta-model is used. A developer needs high-quality libraries in their programming languages to build the Asset Administration Shell in efficient and ergonomic way. The existing representations of the meta-model are inconvenient for moving from the specification to realizations in software development. This leads to many, often manual, re-implementations of the Asset Administration Shell in each programming language. We present an approach to automatically generate libraries based on the intermediate representation of the meta-model. The approach allows for practical and simple development process of Industrie 4.0 components, and scales across programming environments and future changes in the meta-model.
Generating customized low-code development platforms for digital twins;JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES;"Dalibor, M; Heithoff, M; Michael, J; Netz, L; Pfeiffer, J; Rumpe, B; Varga, S; Wortmann, A";;J;;A digital twin improves our use of a cyber-physical system and understanding of its emerging behavior. To this effect, a digital twin is to be developed and configured and potentially also operated by domain experts, who rarely have a professional software engineering background and for whom easy access and support, e.g., in form of low-code platforms are missing. In this paper, we report on an integrated method for the model driven engineering of low-code development platforms for digital twins that enables domain experts to create and operate digital twins for cyber-physical systems using the most appropriate modeling languages. The foundation of this method is (1) a code generation infrastructure for information systems combined with (2) an extensible base architecture for self-adaptive digital twins and (3) reusable language components for their configuration. Using this method, software engineers first configure the information system with the required modeling languages to generate the low-code development platform for digital twins before domain experts leverage the generated platform to create digital twins. This two-step method facilitates creating tailored low-code development platforms as well as creating and operating customized digital twins for a variety of applications.
Multisource Model-Driven Digital Twin System of Robotic Assembly;IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL;"Li, X; He, B; Zhou, YM; Li, G";;J;;"The digital twin technology effectively fuels improvements in the quality and efficiency of robotic assembly, especially for sophisticated processes. High-quality digitalization requires a comprehensive description and real-time rendering of system, which are challenging. This article aims to demonstrate a novel multisource model-driven digital twin system, which is based on the geometric, physics, and sequential rule descriptions for producing a precise and real-time simulation of a robotic assembly system. In our system, the digital counterpart rendered with virtual reality technology is created and updated by the real environment information. A 3-D graphic model is reconstructed first using the geometric information of surroundings captured by the depth sensor. During interaction, a fast and efficient approach is proposed to generate the contact force and render the object deformation in the virtual environment. The virtual space also provides the sequential rule that is based on the danger field, which helps to constrain the operation of digital twin. At last, the experimental platform is established in which the virtual space is at an update rate of 100 Hz, while the automatic sorting task is performed and verified; the results show the effectiveness and applicability of the method to digital twin system."
Model-driven engineering city spaces via bidirectional model transformations;SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING;"Visconti, E; Tsigkanos, C; Hu, ZJ; Ghezzi, C";;J;;"Engineering cyber-physical systems inhabiting contemporary urban spatial environments demands software engineering facilities to support design and operation. Tools and approaches in civil engineering and architectural informatics produce artifacts that are geometrical or geographical representations describing physical spaces. The models we consider conform to the CityGML standard; although relying on international standards and accessible in machine-readable formats, such physical space descriptions often lack semantic information that can be used to support analyses. In our context, analysis as commonly understood in software engineering refers to reasoning on properties of an abstracted model-in this case a city design. We support model-based development, firstly by providing a way to derive analyzable models from CityGML descriptions, and secondly, we ensure that changes performed are propagated correctly. Essentially, a digital twin of a city is kept synchronized, in both directions, with the information from the actual city. Specifically, our formal programming technique and accompanying technical framework assure that relevant information added, or changes applied to the domain (resp. analyzable) model are reflected back in the analyzable (resp. domain) model automatically and coherently. The technique developed is rooted in the theory of bidirectional transformations, which guarantees that synchronization between models is consistent and well behaved. Produced models can bootstrap graph-theoretic, spatial or dynamic analyses. We demonstrate that bidirectional transformations can be achieved in practice on real city models."
Towards a Reference Architecture for Leveraging Model Repositories for Digital Twins;2020 25TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND FACTORY AUTOMATION (ETFA);"Lehner, D; Wolny, S; Mazak-Huemer, A; Wimmer, M";;C;;In the area of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the degree of complexity continuously increases mainly due to new key-enabling technologies supporting those systems. One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS's behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such logical models are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case.
GRuM-A flexible model-driven runtime monitoring framework and its application to automated aerial and ground vehicles;JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE;"Vierhauser, M; Garmendia, A; Stadler, M; Wimmer, M; Cleland-Huang, J";;J;;Runtime monitoring is critical for ensuring safe operation and for enabling self-adaptive behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Monitors are established by identifying runtime properties of interest, creating probes to instrument the system, and defining constraints to be checked at runtime. For many systems, implementing and setting up a monitoring platform can be tedious and time-consuming, as generic monitoring platforms do not adequately cover domain-specific monitoring requirements. This situation is exacerbated when the System under Monitoring (SuM) evolves, requiring changes in the monitoring platform. Most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for dealing with system evolution. In this paper, we present GRuM (Generating CPS Runtime Monitors), a framework that combines model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring, to automatically generate a customized monitoring platform for a given SuM. Relevant properties are captured in a Domain Model Fragment, and changes to the SuM can be easily accommodated by automatically regenerating the platform code. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance we evaluated GRuM against two different systems using TurtleBot robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Results show that GRuM facilitates the creation and evolution of a runtime monitoring platform with little effort and that the platform can handle a substantial amount of events and data.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Performance Evaluation: Model-Driven or Problem-Driven?;QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF SYSTEMS (QEST 2021);Haverkort, BR;;C;;In this paper I address the divide that has emerged between the field of performance evaluation and the field of computer and communication system design. After looking back briefly on the history of the field, I subsequently reflect on the reasons why the field of performance evaluation has become so isolated. I then continue with a set of eight recommendations, based on my experience in performing projects with industry, that will help in reconnecting, and that will result in a better uptake of the newest techniques and tools in the field of design of computer and communication systems. Following these recommendations will probably push scientists a little out of their comfort zone, however, I feel the potential extra reward of seeing our work truly applied is more than worth it.
A software engineering point of view on digital twin architecture;2022 IEEE 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND FACTORY AUTOMATION (ETFA);"Bechu, G; Beugnard, A; Cao, CGL; Perez, Q; Urtado, C; Vauttier, S";;C;;Digital twins, along with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, have been identified as one of the key technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the definition of Digital Twin (DT) is still abstract and context-dependent. In this paper, we present a metamodel that supports concrete and operational descriptions of digital twin deployment. This metamodel encompasses the different aspects of deployment, including the definition of hardware and software components that compose the layered cyber-physical architectures of the digital twin, along with the installation and instantiation tasks that compose deployment processes. Multiple configurations can also be defined to support the deployment of a digital twin in different execution contexts. The relevance of this metamodel was evaluated by two case studies. The first consists in deploying the digital twin of a cobot in a simulation environment. The second applies the approach in a home automation environment. In both cases, our metamodel provides complete and precise descriptions of the deployment process and thus constitutes a viable first step towards a modeldriven approach for digital twin deployment.
On the Notion of Digital Twins: A Modeling Perspective;SYSTEMS;Tekinerdogan, B;;J;;A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical entity that can be remotely controlled, which allows for sophisticated control for a variety of reasons. Digital twins are made possible using various technologies such as Internet of Things, sensor technology, artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning. With this, it represents a new stage in smart systems engineering. Developing digital twin-based systems necessitates a holistic system engineering approach in which modeling is critical. Various studies have been published on the notion of digital twins and its applications in various domains, but a modeling perspective has not been explicitly considered. Hence, this article provides a novel insight on the notion of digital twins from a modeling perspective, describing the evolution of modeling in engineering and likewise providing a rational basis for digital twins as a next logical step in modeling. A metamodel is provided that integrates the key concepts of systems engineering, digital twins, and modeling. While elaborating on the existing evolution of modeling in engineering, it is stated that the next step of digital twins will be artificial twins.
Integration Challenges for Digital Twin Systems-of-Systems;10TH IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR SYSTEMS-OF-SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEMS (SESOS 2022);"Michael, J; Pfeiffer, J; Rumpe, B; Wortmann, A";;C;;Research and industry leverage digital twins to monitor and control (cyber-physical) systems in various domains. For their efficient engineering, these twins need to become Systems-of-Systems (SoS), in which digital twins of smaller systems (e.g., a production machine) become parts of digital twins of larger systems (e.g., a factory). Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS. These insights may guide future research on engineering digital twins as well as practitioners considering the challenges in building and composing digital twin systems-of-systems.
A Comparative Study on Digital Twin Models;ADVANCES IN MATERIALS, MACHINERY, ELECTRONICS III;"Liu, Q; Liu, B; Wang, G; Zhang, C";;C;;As the main concept, the Digital Twin (DT) shows its potential not only in industry 4.0 but also in other areas. One of the keys that decide the future of DT been known as its model technology. Through models can integrate features, behaviors, and properties of DT artifacts with efficiency, reusability, and interoperability, in order to build a complete mapping between the physical world and digital world, after that realize the ideal DT. This paper aims at comparing and analyzing the DT models in the scientific literature, retracing them from the initial one to the models in most recent researches. Thus, this study also emphasizes several principles of the DT model technology that is related to future work.
Digital Twin of an Electrical Motor Based on Empirical Performance Model;2020 XI INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL POWER DRIVE SYSTEMS (ICEPDS);"Rassolkin, A; Rjabtsikov, V; Vaimann, T; Kallaste, A; Kuts, V; Partyshev, A";;C;;The concept of Digital Twin is creating and maintaining a digital representation of the real physical entity and supporting its performance utilizing simulation and optimization tools, which are fed with real data. Development and implementation of Digital Twin technology is a hot topic in many industry-oriented research projects. However, more detailed studies are needed on design methods for Digital Twins, which allows full synchronization and connectivity between virtual and real environments. This paper presents a development case study of Digital Twin for an electric motor based on an empirical performance model. The paper discusses the way how the data required for the Digital Twin were obtained and present a detailed structural description of the virtual entity. Unity3D is used for physics simulations and visualization of the Digital Twin, because of simple accessible and meticulously detailed documentation highly useful for rapid prototyping in early stages.
A pattern catalog for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavior;AT-AUTOMATISIERUNGSTECHNIK;"Lehner, D; Sint, S; Eisenberg, M; Wimmer, M";;J;;Digital Twins are emerging as a solution to build and extend existing software systems to make better use of data produced by physical systems. For supporting the development of Digital Twins, several software vendors are offering dedicated tool support, often referred to as Digital Twin platforms. The modeling capabilities of these platforms are mostly concerned with structural viewpoints, i.e., providing an overview of available components including their current and historical sensor values. However, behavioral viewpoints did not yet receive much attention on these platforms. As behavioral models are often used during the design processes, e.g., for simulation and synthesis, it would be beneficial for having them included in Digital Twin platforms, e.g., for reasoning on the set of possible next actions or for checking the execution history to perform runtime validation. In this paper, we present a catalog of modeling patterns for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavioral models and their corresponding runtime information without requiring any extension of the code bases of Digital Twin platforms. We demonstrate the presented modeling patterns by applying them to the Digital Twin platform offered by Microsoft, in an additive manufacturing use case of a 3D printer in a production line.
EMF-Syncer: scalable maintenance of view models over heterogeneous data-centric software systems at run time;SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING;Boronat, A;;J;;With the increasing presence of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), like autonomous vehicle systems and digital twins, the future of software engineering is predicated on the importance of designing and developing data-centric software systems that can adapt intelligently at run time. CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems.
Dynamic design method of digital twin process model driven by knowledge-evolution machining features;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH;"Liu, JF; Zhao, P; Jing, XW; Cao, XW; Sheng, SS; Zhou, HG; Liu, XJ; Feng, F";;J;;Machining plan is the core of guiding manufacturing production and is regarded as one of the keys to ensure the quality of product processing. Existing process design methods are inefficient to quickly handle the machining plan changed induced by the unpredictable events in real-time production. It inevitably causes time and economic losses for the enterprise. In order to express the evolutionary characteristics of product processing, the construction method of digital twin process model (DTPM) is proposed based on the knowledge-evolution machining features. Three key technologies include correlation structure of process knowledge, expression method of the evolution geometric features and the association mechanism between two are solved. On this basis, the construction framework of DTPM is illustrated. Then, the organisation and management mechanism of multi-source heterogeneous data is discussed in detail. At last, a case study of the complex machined part is researched, the results show that the processing time reduced by about 7% and the processing stability improved by 40%. Meanwhile, the implementation scheme, application process and effect of this case are described in detail to provide reference for enterprises.
Digital Twin Service Unit for AC Motor Stator Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Detection;2021 28TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ELECTRIC DRIVES: IMPROVING RELIABILITY OF ELECTRIC DRIVES (IWED2021);"Rjabtsikov, V; Rassolkin, A; Asad, B; Vaimann, T; Kallaste, A; Kuts, V; Jegorov, S; Stepien, M; Krawczyk, M";;C;;A modern trend for industry digitalization brings new demands for the development and application of the modeling and simulation approach. It is already not enough to have only a virtual representation of the object and run it independently from the physical object. The Digital Twin (DT) aspect indicates a connection between the physical object and the corresponding virtual twin established by generating real-time data using sensors. The DT represents physical object operation throughout its life cycle, making it an essential tool for improving that object's reliability. In this paper, an application of the DT service unit for AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection is presented. According to real-time measurements, Linux Robot Operation System (ROS) simulates AC electrical machine-specific behavior in case of unbalanced stator currents and notify about possible fault appearance and propagation. Fault, such as discussed in the paper (AC machine stator inter-turn) is considered one of the most prevalent possible electrical motor failure.
Meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin architecture, modeling and application;ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING;"Yang, XL; Liu, XM; Zhang, H; Fu, L; Yu, YB";;J;;Digital twin is regarded as the virtual counterpart of physical entities, which can mirror the physical behavior and performance. Digital twin technology provides strong support for the achievement of cyber-physical system and intelligent manufacturing. Many investigations have been carried out for the digital twin of specific prod-ucts. However, there are less researches on digital twin in the shop-floor domain, and there is a lack of model-driven digital twin comprehensive architecture. The modeling approach to the full lifecycle of digital twin is not considered enough. This paper proposes a meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin construction approach and a comprehensive architecture. A meta-model based on RAMI 4.0 is constructed, which provide a novel idea for the description of manufacturing resources and their status. The proposed shop-floor digital twin architecture consists of three key implementation elements: the meta-model construction, data modeling (including data interaction between cyber-physical spaces) and constructing different integration level models of shop-floor digital twin based on iteration feedback between the demands and models. The proposed approach is vali-dated through a case study of the fischer learning factory 4.0.
Automated Model Transformation in modeling Digital Twins of Industrial Internet-of-Things Applications utilizing AutomationML;2021 26TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND FACTORY AUTOMATION (ETFA);"Binder, C; Cala, A; Vollmar, J; Neureiter, C; Luder, A";;C;;In recent years, the manufacturing industry sector has undergone major changes. Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software. The results of this approach are thereby evaluated by a real-world case study, which is applied according to the concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0).

Interface Development for Digital Twin of an Electric Motor Based on Empirical Performance Model;IEEE ACCESS;"Rassolkin, A; Rjabtsikov, V; Kuts, V; Vaimann, T; Kallaste, A; Asad, B; Partyshev, A";;J;;The concept of Digital Twin is creating and maintaining a digital representation of the real physical entity and supporting its performance utilizing simulation and optimization tools, which are fed with the real data obtained from the physical equipment. Development and implementation of the Digital Twin technology are one of the main challenges for today's industry, more detailed studies are needed on design methods for Digital Twins. Besides using Digital Twin as a high-quality simulation, one of the commitments is monitoring and maintaining control of the whole system via a constant live link between virtual and physical entities. The related research study presents a detailed structural description of the developed Digital Twin virtual entity and the development of a framework that allows Robot Operating System (ROS) to securely communicate with remote Digital Twins via the Internet and harness ROS's adaptability across vast distances and multiple systems. This paper is an extended version of the authors' International Conference on Electrical Power Drive Systems (ICEPDS20) paper, in which we propose a development case study of Digital Twin for an electric motor based on an empirical performance model.
Digital twin enhanced human-machine interaction in product lifecycle;11TH CIRP CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEMS;"Ma, X; Tao, F; Zhang, M; Wang, T; Zuo, Y";;C;;Human-machine interaction (HMI) is a key technology for implementing smart manufacturing, which primarily focuses on the issues of communication, interaction, and cooperation between humans and machines. HMI has been widely studied in product lifecycle including product design, manufacturing, and service, but the efficiency and safety still cannot meet the new requirements for smart manufacturing along with new emerging technologies (e.g., big data, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, etc.). Digital twin (DT), as a new technology to realize cyber-physical integration, provides a new chance to address the above problems. Using a five-dimension DT model driven by real-time data, HMI will generate a more flexible interactive mode to improve machine efficiency and operation safety. In this paper, HMI in product lifecycle is investigated first, and the shortness and new requirements are analyzed, then a DT enhanced HMI framework is proposed to address the shortness.

Digital modeling-driven chatter suppression for thin-walled part manufacturing;JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING;"Zhou, G; Zhou, K; Zhang, J; Yuan, M; Wang, XH; Feng, PF; Zhang, M; Feng, F";;J;;Thin-walled parts are widely used in various industries such as aerospace and automotive, but the manufacturing processes are often harmed by chatter which is a self-excited vibration because of the poor rigidity in the direction perpendicular to the wall surface. The traditional stability lobe diagram (SLD) method can predict chatter based on the manufacturing system and workpiece parameters. However, these parameters could vary along with the manufacturing execution, compromising SLD's accuracy and even feasibility. To enable effective chatter suppression in thin-walled part milling, this study proposes a digital twin model, where two sub-models including the cutting parameters optimization and chatter detection are established. In the sub-model of cutting parameters optimization, a real-time SLD considering the time-varying modal parameters at the cutting region of the workpiece is generated as the optimization criteria. The sub-model of chatter detection can recognize chatter by a fusional analysis of the multiple sensors' signals, including vibration, force, and sound. Considering the bias of real-time SLD, these two sub-models are combined to output optimized cutting parameters to avoid chatter. Besides, a monitoring window to visualize the milling scenario and a database to record the manufacturing data are implemented in the digital twin model. According to the milling experiments, the digital twin model is validated to perform more effectively in chatter suppression than the traditional stationary SLD method.
Potential and limitations of digital twins to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals;NATURE SUSTAINABILITY;"Tzachor, A; Sabri, S; Richards, CE; Rajabifard, A; Acuto, M";;J;;Could computer simulation models drive our ambitions to sustainability in urban and non-urban environments? Digital twins, defined here as real-time, virtual replicas of physical and biological entities, may do just that. However, despite their touted potential, digital twins have not been examined critically in urban sustainability paradigms-not least in the Sustainable Development Goals framework. Accordingly, in this Perspective, we examine their benefits in promoting the Sustainable Development Goals. Then, we discuss critical limitations when modelling socio-technical and socio-ecological systems and go on to discuss measures to treat these limitations and design inclusive, reliable and responsible computer simulations for achieving sustainable development. Little is known about the potential of digital twins in the pursuit of sustainability. This study examines the likely benefits of digital twins in urban sustainability paradigms, their limitations when modelling socio-technical and socio-ecological systems and possible ways to attenuate them.
Digital Twin Enables Rational Design of Ultrahigh-Power Lithium-Ion Batteries;ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS;"Zhang, HM; Ren, DS; Ming, H; Zhang, WF; Cao, GP; Liu, JH; Wang, L; Song, JL; Qiu, JY; Wang, JL; He, XM; Zhang, H";;J;;With the widespread applications of electric vehicles, power grid stabilization, and high-pulsed power loads, high-power lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are in urgent demand. However, the existing experimental-based design of high-power batteries is usually costly and inefficient, and provides limited information on the complex physicochemical processes inside the batteries. Digital twin concept is promising for capturing the batteries' electrochemical performance, and optimizing the power capability of LIBs. Here, an electrochemical-thermal coupled model is developed as a digital twin model for rational design of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite LIBs. The model can accurately predict the batteries' performance and help to predetermine the optimal parameters to achieve an ultrahigh power capability. After model-guided optimization, the battery shows a high energy density of 92.38 Wh kg(-1) at an ultrafast discharging current of 50 C and can withstand 150 C pulse discharging tests. Notably, the digital twin model can reveal experimentally inaccessible time- and space-resolved information and identify the rate-determining steps inside the battery. Hence, model-driven optimization of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite batteries is successfully realized aiming at the critical factors in the rate-determining steps. The work provides an instructive design of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite batteries, which might guide the future direction to boost the power capability of LIBs.
Learning to Predict and Optimize Imperfect MIMO System Performance: Framework and Application;2022 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM 2022);"Su, JY; Meng, F; Liu, SH; Huang, YM; Lu, ZH";;C;;In imperfect multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, model-based methods for performance prediction and optimization generally experience degradation in the dynamically changing environment with unknown interference and uncertain channel state information (CSI). To adapt to such challenging settings and better accomplish the network auto-tuning tasks, we propose a generic learnable model-driven framework. We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results.
Knowledge driven rapid development of white box digital twins for industrial plant systems;IECON 2021 - 47TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY;"Amar, B; Subhrojyoti, RC; Barnali, B; Dhakshinamoorthy, R; Seenivasan, A; Naveenkumar, S";;C;;Industrial systems like power plants need a significant domain and engineering expertise for their efficient operations. Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture. Our approach to developing a DT supporting a fault management scenario in a power plant reduced 70% development time and 50% manual efforts.

It fosters the definition of a digital twin of the city, namely a cyber-physical counterpart of all the city systems and sub-systems. Here we propose a novel approach to UI that extends available frameworks combining advanced multidisciplinary modelling of the city, simulation and learning tools with numerical optimization techniques, each of them specialized for the digital representation of city systems and subsystems, including not only city infrastructures, but also city users and their interactions.

Interactive Smart Space for Single-Person Households Using Electroencephalogram through Fusion of Digital Twin and Artificial Intelligence;ENERGIES;Ji, SY;;J;;The core technology for building a smart space includes the capability to analyse the space for users using various sensors. The purpose of this study was to propose a personalised interactive smart space implementation model driven by the fusion of digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data. This study utilised a handheld EEG sensor to identify a user's emotion information and focused on the connection with the space. A smart space for single-person households that responds to EEG-based biometric information was designed for an interactive space that can improve the current emotional state of the space user. The technical characteristics of DT and AI were analysed to control spatial changes according to the user's emotional state and to address safety-related issues. Furthermore, a fusion mechanism for DT and AI was developed for intelligent motor control to change the dimensions of the space in order to improve the EEG state of the user. In addition, using an AI model that converts EEG data into emotional state information, the user's emotional state was analysed, and key issues related to the spatial dimensions and change of space that induce psychological stability were investigated.

A Methodology for Digital Twin Modeling and Deployment for Industry 4.0;PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE;"Schroeder, GN; Steinmetz, C; Rodrigues, RN; Henriques, RVB; Rettberg, A; Pereira, CE";;J;;"The digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical object, which has been proposed as one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0. The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT."
Holistic Network Virtualization and Pervasive Network Intelligence for 6G;IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS;"Shen, XM; Gao, J; Wu, W; Li, MS; Zhou, CH; Zhuang, WH";;J;;In this tutorial paper, we look into the evolution and prospect of network architecture and propose a novel conceptual architecture for the 6th generation (6G) networks. The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and developments on the potential architecture of 6G.

Digital Twin Driven Green Performance Evaluation Methodology of Intelligent Manufacturing: Hybrid Model Based on Fuzzy Rough-Sets AHP, Multistage Weight Synthesis, and PROMETHEE II;COMPLEXITY;"Li, LH; Mao, CL; Sun, HX; Yuan, YP; Lei, BB";;J;;The design, planning, and implementation of intelligent manufacturing are mainly carried out from the perspectives of meeting the needs of mass customization, improving manufacturing capacity, and innovating business pattern currently. Environmental and social factors should be systematically integrated into the life cycle of intelligent manufacturing. In view of this, a green performance evaluation methodology of intelligent manufacturing driven by digital twin is proposed in this paper. Digital twin framework, which constructs the bidirectional mapping and real-time data interaction between physical entity and digital model, provides the green performance evaluation with a total factor virtual image of the whole life cycle to meet the monitoring and simulation requirements of the evaluation information source and demand. Driven by the digital twin framework, a novel hybrid MCDM model based on fuzzy rough-sets AHP, multistage weight synthesis, and PROMETHEE II is proposed as the methodology for the green performance evaluation of intelligent manufacturing. The model is tested and validated on a study of the green performance evaluation of remote operation and maintenance service project evaluation for an air conditioning enterprise. Testing demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model driven by digital twin can enable a stable and reasonable evaluation result. A sensitivity analysis was carried out by means of 27 scenarios, the results of which showed a high degree of stability.

Modular Fault Ascription and Corrective Maintenance Using a Digital Twin;IFAC PAPERSONLINE;"Vathoopan, M; Johny, M; Zoitl, A; Knoll, A";;C;;The industrial environment is slowly transforming to a networked system of systems nature with industry 4.0. Automation systems are getting more production friendly by being more reconfigurable and adaptable. The plant engineering process is also getting improved by offering modular architecture, model-based engineering, etc. This transformation necessitates novel methodologies in maintenance practices as well. With the emergence of predictive maintenance techniques, sometimes it is possible to predict a breakdown and thus conveniently schedule the corrective maintenance. But this is not always the case, the incidence of unscheduled corrective maintenance is prevalent in an industrial environment. And the methodologies for corrective maintenance have to be reshaped fitting to the new plant environment. This paper introduces a new modular corrective maintenance methodology, using the digital twin of an automation module. Fault ascription support for a human technician, performing corrective maintenance action of an automation module is provided by its digital twin and associated visual interface. A use case scenario is propounded and future visions are presented. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A digital twin-driven hybrid approach for the prediction of performance degradation in transmission unit of CNC machine tool;ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING;"Yang, X; Ran, Y; Zhang, GB; Wang, HW; Mu, ZY; Zhi, SG";;J;;Precision performance prediction of transmission system is considered as a key technology to modern equipment health management. Given the importance of maintaining a transmission system's precision, this paper presents a hybrid approach framework driven by digital twin technology (DT), to predict performance degradation. Firstly, a DT model based on meta-action theory is established, and real-time monitoring and digital simulation, driven by DT data, is realized in order to analyze the precision of the transmission units in machine tools. Secondly, the wear of gear in transmission unit is studied through Achard wear theory, which considered the comprehensive influence of gear load and speed on surface wear of the gear pair tooth, based on the model driving method. The performance degradation of the transmission unit is obtained by using the RBF neural network algorithm based on the data-driven method to extrapolate the wear data to the field-measurable precision index value. In addition, the hybrid predictive approach of the performance degradation model through the particle filter algorithm is built, and the real-time data is used to update the current state estimation to improve the prediction accuracy. By combining the mechanism of the physical degradation processes with the real-time and historical data and turning them into a cooperative architecture, this prediction method uses the complementary advantages offered by the fusion of these methods to bridge the link between data-driven prediction and model-based prediction. Finally, the method has been successfully applied to the precision prediction of the transmission unit in CNCMT turntable, and it is compared with the single prediction method to verify the effectiveness and feasibility.
A multi-model ensemble digital twin solution for real-time unsteady flow state estimation of a pumping station;ISA TRANSACTIONS;"He, L; Wen, K; Gong, J; Wu, CC";;J;;This paper proposes a digital twin solution for unsteady flow state estimation in a pumping station. Digital twin is expected to accurately estimate the real-time hydraulic parameters of blind spots of the pumping station system even under some adverse conditions including the interference of observation noise and model parameters drift. To solve these challenges, a digital twin framework integrating the model-driven method, control theory and data-driven method is presented. In this framework, an unsteady flow state estimation method combining frequency domain analysis and generalized predictive control theory is developed for the first time, which is superior to traditional time-domain numerical discrete methods in terms of computational efficiency and anti-noise interference. In the model parameter calibration process, the novelty concerns modeling of the optimization problem considering the dynamic operation control of the station and unsteady flow of pipelines. And this process is accomplished through the comprehensive application of the model-free adaptive control algorithm, the transient flow model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. This work is applied to a pumping station in a product pipeline to verify its effectiveness in estimating the transient flow state of data blind spots and map the dynamic operation behavior under the interference of colored noise and parameter drift.

Ensuring consistency in scalable-detail models for DT-based control;IFAC PAPERSONLINE;"Cimino, C; Leva, A; Ferretti, G";;C;;Digital Twins (DTs for short) are a powerful aid for creating, assessing and maintaining control strategies. This use of DTs however requires that the physical entities to control be described at different levels of detail. For example, simple I/O models are used to compute parameters of modulating controllers, more time-accurate ones may be required to set up and assess logic controls, high-accuracy, possibly nonlinear ones may serve for overall strategy verification, and for software-in-the-loop testing, also the host computing/network architecture needs representing. In such a complex scenario, guaranteeing that all the descriptions of all elements are consistent with one another is a relevant problem. We discuss this matter and propose a solution, in the form of a modelling paradigm where as a novel contributions relationships (in a sense analogous to what the term means in database theory) can be instated and enforced. This allows to create and maintain knowledge based made of interrelate data and models, embracing all the major DT interpretations proposed so far in the literature, or said more explicitly, combining data-driven and model-driven DTs in a single framework. We also provide an illustrative example. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.
An AAS Modeling Tool for Capability-Based Engineering of Flexible Production Lines;IECON 2021 - 47TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY;"Huang, YN; Dhouib, S; Malenfant, J";;C;;The future intelligent manufacturing systems should possess a high degree of autonomy, which is able to monitor the entire production process, quickly re-plan operations, and respond to various unforeseen situations in a secure and safe manner. This can achieve rapid response to customers and avoid costly machine downtime, which is crucial to maintaining business success and profitability. The Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emerging standard in the 14.0 (Industry 4.0) domain. Based on the concept of digital twins, it provides concepts for describing the digital representation of 14.0 assets including their capabilities and skills. The AAS provides also responses to the challenge of syntactic and semantic interoperability that the flexible and autonomous production lines are facing. In this article, we propose a capability-based operation and engineering approach for flexible production lines. Our approach is relying on the AAS standard which is a very wide and rich specification. Consequently, we describe the subset of AAS modelling concepts necessary for our approach, we clarify their semantics and we show their usage through a production cell use case. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these modelling concepts were tooled as an extension of the open source model-driven workbench Papyrus.

The speed with which manufacturers, in particular SMEs, can reconfigure the production to a new run and thus respond to clients and avoid costly machine downtime is critical to maintaining commercial success and profit margins. The manufacturing systems of tomorrow must offer a high degree of autonomy, be quickly re-planned to other operations, and cope with a wide variety of unforeseen situations, in a secure and safe manner. In this context, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emergent standard that leverages the digital twin approach and provides concepts for describing capabilities and skills of I4.0 components in order to automate the reconfiguration process.

Applying a Healthcare Web of Things Framework for Infertility Treatments;WEB ENGINEERING (ICWE 2022);"Gorelova, A; Melia, S";;C;;According to doctors and researchers, fertility problems are becoming epidemic proportions. Meanwhile, the demand for infertility treatment is increasing by 5-10% per year. To support the growing demand, physicians need to define personalized remote monitoring treatments supported by devices that send real-time information on hormones levels, heart-rate, temperature, etc. To this end, Healthcare Monitoring Systems (HMS) have recently appeared, based on increasingly advanced devices that help to manage this task. However, current solutions are expensive and not very customizable by physicians themselves. In this paper, we propose a framework called MoSTHealth, based on digital twins and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), allows healthcare experts to model a personalized Web of Things (WoT) HMS scenario per treatment and per patient. Thanks to MDE, the simulated scenario allows us to generate a Service-Oriented enterprise cloud architecture that integrates a prediction module based on machine learning and data analysis. In this paper, a WoT HMS scenario for infertility treatment is presented as a case study. In this scenario, a specific care plan is defined, associated with a set of devices, including the use of a biosensing device that sends hormones levels in real-time.
A data-model fusion dispatch strategy for the building energy flexibility based on the digital twin;APPLIED ENERGY;"Song, YG; Xia, MC; Chen, QF; Chen, FJ";;J;;With the growing percentage of the intermittent renewable power generation, the energy system is under increasing pressure in balancing the supply and the demand. As a major part of urban energy consumptions, buildings can provide considerable regulation flexibility for the energy system by actively managing their energy demands. For the building energy flexibility (BEF) provided by thermostatically controlled loads (TCL), its dispatch performance is vulnerable to the building thermal parameter errors, and in some cases, occupants need to provide the critical information related to the indoor temperature state and the occupancy state to the energy management system outside buildings, which decreases the availability of the BEF and raises privacy concerns. For these issues in the BEF utilization, this paper proposes a data-model fusion dispatch strategy based on the digital twin (DT). The proposed strategy is capable of parameter fault tolerance and privacy protection by combining the model-free advantage of the data-driven method with the analytical optimization advantage of the model-driven method. Firstly, a DT-based BEF dispatch framework is proposed. Secondly, the building DT is established by combining the building thermal dynamics (BTD) data-driven model and the TCL operation mechanism model. And the building response deduction is carried out based on the DT. Finally, under the rolling optimization framework, the data-model fusion dispatch strategy is devised by uniting the DT deduction and the optimization constructed by the BTD mechanism model, in which the multi-dimensional modeling of the BTD is carried out from the state dimension and the energy dimension. The simulation results show that the optimization result can reach 98.4% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% parameter random error, and 98.3% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% random state noise injection.
A New Modeling Approach for Power Grid Online Analysis;IFAC PAPERSONLINE;"Zhou, MK; Feng, DH";;C;;A new modeling approach for power grid online analysis is proposed to support the realization of a new online analysis system architecture. The model-driven software development, automatic code generation, and in-memory computing techniques are employed in the modeling approach. Data source adapters are developed for the integration of the model with the existing EMS system. A large-scale power grid online network data model (similar to 40K-bus) is used for the model performance testing in a Lab environment. The proposed modeling approach was used to develop a new online analysis application, which was deployed and running in a provincial grid dispatching control center. The Lab and field performance measurement shows that the modeling approach-based application can achieve second-order end-to-end responsiveness. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.
The OMiLAB Digital Innovation environment: Agile conceptual models to bridge business value with Digital and Physical Twins for Product-Service Systems development;COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY;"Karagiannis, D; Buchmann, RA; Utz, W";;J;;OMiLAB is a community of practice which offers a digital ecosystem bringing together open technologies to investigate and apply conceptual modeling methods for varying purposes and domains. One of the core value propositions is a dedicated Digital Innovation environment comprising several toolkits and workspaces, designed to support Product-Service Systems (PSS) prototyping - a key ingredient for PSS lifecycle management. At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin - a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles.

The Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communications will provide a wide range of new applications and business opportunities, but with a wide and quite complex attack surface. Several users are not aware of the underlying threats and most of them do not possess the knowledge to set and operate the various digital assets securely. Therefore, cyber security training is becoming mandatory both for simple users and security experts. Cyber ranges constitute an advance training technique where trainees gain hands-on experiences on a safe virtual environment, which can be a realistic digital twin of an actual system. This paper presents the cyber ranges platform THREAT-ARREST. Its design is fully model-driven and offers all modern training features (i.e. emulation, simulation, serious games, and fabricated data). The platform has been evaluated under the smart energy, intelligent transportation, and healthcare domains.
Simulation-Based Engineering of Heterogeneous Collaborative Systems-A Novel Conceptual Framework;SUSTAINABILITY;"Perisic, A; Perisic, I; Perisic, B";;J;;We discuss the collaboration support of loosely coupled Smart Systems through configurable hyper-frameworks. Based on the system-of-systems (SoS) paradigm, in this article, we propose the model of a novel extendible conceptual framework with domain-specific moderation support for model-based simulations and the engineering of complex heterogeneous systems. The domain knowledge meta-model and corresponding management enterprise architecture enable the creation of template-based specializations. The proposed SoS conceptual framework meta-model represents an initial framework prototype that supports modeling, simulation, analysis, and utilization of dynamic architecting of heterogeneous SoS configurations. A Smart-Habitat concept encapsulating Smart-Area, Smart-City, Smart-Lot, Smart-Building, and Smart-Unit abstractions illustrate the frameworks' applicability. The proposed SoS conceptual framework represents the initial conceptual support for modeling, simulation, analysis, and dynamic architecting of heterogeneous SoS configurations. We plan to refine the component architecture meta-model, specify a language workbench with Domain-Specific Orchestration Language support, and verify the configuration-based simulation manifest creation. These actions lead to the framework's next stage, an operational framework (OF) instance, as a transitional artifact to the aimed software framework (SwF) counterpart.
Improving Digital Twin Experience Reports;PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (MODELSWARD);"Oakes, BJ; Parsai, A; Van Mierlo, S; Demeyer, S; Denil, J; De Meulenaere, P; Vangheluwe, H";;C;;Digital twins (DTs) are prevalent throughout industrial domains as evidenced by the rapid pace of experience reports in the literature. However, there remains disagreement about the precise definition of a DT and the essential characteristics in the DT paradigm, such as the scope of the system-under-study and the time-scale of its communication with the DT. These experience reports could therefore be hampering further classification and research insights by not reporting all of these relevant details about the DT solutions. We address these concerns by providing a conceptual structure for DTs as a common understanding and checklist for researchers and practitioners to precisely describe the characteristics and capabilities of their DT solutions. We express five experience reports using our structure to demonstrate its applicability and role as a guideline to improve the reporting of characteristics and increase the clarity of future experience reports.
Inference of Simulation Models in Digital Twins by Reinforcement Learning;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"David, I; Galasso, J; Syriani, E";;C;;"The typical optimization and control activities of Digital Twins are driven by high-performance simulators. Due to the significant complexity of systems subject to digital twinning, constructing simulators of appropriate details is a costly and error-prone endeavor. To alleviate these problems, we propose an approach for inferring simulation models of Digital Twins by machine learning. Instead of learning the simulation model of one specific simulator, we aim at learning their construction process. This generality enables reusing the inferred knowledge in different (but congruent) Digital Twin settings. To achieve this level of generality, we propose the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism for capturing simulation models; and reinforcement learning (RL) for inferring DEVS models. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges in combining these two techniques."
UAV-Assisted Three-Dimensional Spectrum Mapping Driven by Spectrum Data and Channel Model;SYMMETRY-BASEL;"Du, XF; Zhu, QM; Ding, GR; Li, J; Wu, QH; Lan, TX; Lin, ZP; Zhong, WZ; Han, L";;J;;As the number of civil aerial vehicles increase explosively, spectrum scarcity and security become an increasingly challenge in both the airspace and terrestrial space. To address this difficulty, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the tensor completion method by about 12.5% and 92.3%, respectively, in terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.
Using UML and OCL Models to Realize High-Level Digital Twins;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Munoz, P; Troya, J; Vallecillo, A";;C;;Digital twins constitute virtual representations of physically existing systems. However, their inherent complexity makes them difficult to develop and prove correct. In this paper we explore the use of UML and OCL, complemented with an executable language, SOIL, to build and test digital twins at a high level of abstraction. We also show how to realize the bidirectional connection between the UML models of the digital twin in the USE tool with the physical twin, using an architectural framework centered on a data lake. We have built a prototype of the framework to demonstrate our ideas, and validated it by developing a digital twin of a Lego Mindstorms car. The results allow us to show some interesting advantages of using high-level UML models to specify virtual twins, such as simulation, property checking and some other types of tests.
Decentralized Autonomous Operations and Organizations in TransVerse: Federated Intelligence for Smart Mobility;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS;"Zhao, C; Dai, XY; Lv, YS; Niu, JL; Lin, YL";;J;;Human and social factors are essential to transportation systems, yet top-down management fails to consider them sufficiently. Consequently, management strategies are not tailored to human needs and are inadequate in providing transportation intelligence. This article investigates a management architecture based on decentralized/distributed autonomous operations/organizations (DAOs) that considers both the technical and societal aspects in our transportation metaverse, TransVerse. This design maps people's transportation needs in physical space to their digital counterparts in cyberspace, utilizing blockchain technology to guarantee the secure exchange of information and ultimately bring about the Internet of Minds (IoM). With the federated intelligence that emerged in IoM, we can devise reliable and prompt traffic decisions by incorporating consensus, community voting, and smart contracts into the organizational, coordination, and execution structure. Details on operational procedures and key technologies are also covered. To demonstrate the efficacy of DAOs-based management, a case study of world model-driven cooperative signal control is provided, indicating its promising application in future transportation management.
A virtual model knowledge updating method driven by data;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY;"Luo, RP; Sheng, BY; Fu, GC; Huang, YZ; Jian, YC; Chen, G";;J;;In the initial construction of unit-level virtual models in the discrete production system, the understanding of physical entities and the actual operating environment is lacking, and the virtual models need to be iteratively updated to resemble the physical entities more closely. To solve the above problems, an updating method for knowledge in the virtual model driven by data is studied. Firstly, the behavior model in the virtual model can be divided into basic functional models such as forward kinematics, trajectory planning, and material generation, and the knowledge components to support functional model computation are constructed. Secondly, the evaluation indexes for the quality, maintainability, and reliability of the knowledge components are established, and appropriate knowledge component combinations can be selected from the knowledge component base. Then, based on the measurements, it is used to the triggering judgment, and a knowledge component combination with the smallest difference between the simulation output of the virtual model and the real data of physical entities is selected from multiple combinations to realize the iterative update of the model. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by examples.
Developing a Physical and Digital Twin: An Example Process Model;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Feng, H; Gomes, C; Sandberg, M; Thule, C; Lausdahl, K; Larsen, PG";;C;;As a result of the fast development of technologies and diversity of requirements, complexity exists not only in a system itself but also in the development process and environment. The complexity in the development process comes from specialization and concurrency, and a Digital Twin (DT) has the potential to mitigate these issues. We hope, during the process of building a DT, the accidental complexity can be minimized by application of model-based systems engineering and the Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM). In this paper, we give an example of the process of building a DT combined with a process model. Our long term goal is to model the development of various DTs to identify the commonalities and variations across multiple DTs.

These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.
Models Meet Data: Challenges to Create Virtual Entities for Digital Twins;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"van den Brand, M; Cleophas, L; Gunasekaran, R; Haverkort, B; Negrin, DAM; Muctadir, HM";;C;;In recent years, digital twin (DT) technology has moved to the center of attention of many researchers and engineers. Commonly, a digital twin is defined based on a virtual entity (VE) that exhibits similar behavior to its physical counterpart, and that is coupled to this physical entity (PE). The VE thus forms a core part of any digital twin. While VEs may differ vastly-from ones based on simple simulation to high-fidelity virtual mirroring of the corresponding PE-they are typically composed of multiple models that may originate from multiple domains, address different aspects, and are expressed and processed using different tools and languages. Furthermore, the use of time series data-whether historical or real-time or both-from the PE distinguishes VEs from mere simulations. As a consequence of the modeling landscape complexity and the data aspect of VEs, the design of a digital twin and specifically of the VE as part of it represents several challenges. In this paper, we present our vision for the development, evolution, maintenance, and verification of such virtual entities for digital twins.
Digital Twin Operational Platform for Connectivity and Accessibility using Flask Python;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Bonney, MS; de Angelis, M; Wagg, D; Dal Borgo, M";;C;;This paper demonstrates an example of an open-source, modular, and system independent framework that has been developed by a team of researchers working for the UK based DigiTwin project. The example in this paper is based on a framework for a digital twin operational platform (DTOP) that uses Flask Python, and is named DTOP-Cristallo. DTOP-Cristallo is an operational platform that uses HTML web pages as the interface between the digital twin simulations, both python based and 3rd party software based, and the user. This framework is particularly useful for connectivity with users, since it can deploy the digital twin with multiple accessibility options to accommodate a wide variety of intended uses.
Using Ptolemy II as a Framework for Virtual Entity Integration and Orchestration in Digital Twins;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Negrin, DAM; Cleophas, L; van den Brand, M";;C;;The concept of Digital Twin (DT) is increasingly getting attention due to its support for digital transformation as part of Industry 4.0. A core component of a DT is the virtual entity (VE) that is meant to 'mirror' the physical entity (PE). A particular challenge for developing this VE is the integration between the different models that typically make up such a VE. These models, covering different disciplines or aspects of a system, commonly are developed by different engineers and expressed in different formalisms given their strengths and weaknesses. This makes integration between these models and formalisms a challenge. Such integration has two aspects: the communication among the models, and their orchestration, which concerns the order of model step execution and data exchange. In this paper, we consider the suitability of Ptolemy II, an open source framework based on an actor-oriented structure, to implement such integration. We use the Ptolemy II framework to reproduce the implementation of a DT of an autonomous scaled-down truck, which originally required a more manual configuration and execution and was developed in a monolithic way. The results show that Ptolemy II can be used to implement different communication technologies as actors, and show the expressiveness of the orchestrators by reproducing the existing DT's behavior. This shows Ptolemy II in principle to be suitable as an integration and orchestration tool for models in the context of DTs. As future work, we plan to apply the framework to more complex DTs using different communication technologies, so as to validate its broader suitability for VE orchestration in DTs.
Combining Low-Code Programming and SDL-Based Modeling with Snap! in the Industry 4.0 Context;24TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS COMPANION (MODELS-C 2021);"Palomes, XPI; Tuset-Peiro, P; Casas, PFI";;C;;One of the main challenges to implement Industry 4.0 technologies within the industrial fabric is the lack of suitable concrete models and tools that demonstrate the potential benefits of embracing the digital transformation process. To overcome this challenge, over the past years, various Industry 4.0 automation and robotics providers have presented solutions based on visual block programming languages, which follow an emerging low-code approach to reduce the entry barriers of digital technologies. However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap! to create SDL4Snap!, an opensource and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes. Overall, the resulting tool has the potential to reduce the entry barrier to Digital Twins in small and medium enterprises, which are part of the late majority and laggard groups regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0.
3D crowdsourced parametric cadastral mapping: Pathways integrating BIM/IFC, crowdsourced data and LADM;LAND USE POLICY;"Gkeli, M; Potsiou, C";;J;;"This paper is part of a doctoral dissertation (PhD) research aligned with global trends aiming to develop practical technical tools for the collection, management and visualization of three-dimensional (3D) property rights in urban areas. Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a 'two-route' crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs - those available - to proceed with 3D crowd -sourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., ortho-photos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data - if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the 'two-route' crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy - in the absence of BIM - are dis-cussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better vi-sual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures."
DataTime: a Framework to smoothly Integrate Past, Present and Future into Models;24TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS (MODELS 2021);"Lyan, G; Jezequel, JM; Gross-Amblard, D; Combemale, B";;C;;Models at runtime have been initially investigated for adaptive systems. Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.
Digital Behavioral Twins for Safe Connected Cars;21ST ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS (MODELS 2018);"Chen, XM; Kang, E; Shiraishi, S; Preciado, VM; Jiang, ZH";;C;;Driving is a social activity which involves endless interactions with other agents on the road. Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis. We also demonstrate that our digital twins framework can accurately predict driver behaviors and effectively prevent collisions using a case study in a virtual driving simulation environment.
