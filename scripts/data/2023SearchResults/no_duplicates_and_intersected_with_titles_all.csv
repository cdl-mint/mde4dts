One of the keys that decide the future of DT been known as its model technology. Through models can integrate features, behaviors, and properties of DT artifacts with efficiency, reusability, and interoperability, in order to build a complete mapping between the physical world and digital world, after that realize the ideal DT. This paper aims at comparing and analyzing the DT models in the scientific literature, retracing them from the initial one to the models in most recent researches. Thus, this study also emphasizes several principles of the DT model technology that is related to future work.||

While sophisticated modeling languages like SysML describe systems and their components, data often ends up in purpose-built relational and time series databases. To generate value, information must be retrieved and integrated from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose an innovative method for leveraging SysML engineering models and database queries by combining them in a collaborative low-code web environment. First, we make heterogeneous databases available via GraphQL, a state-of-the-art approach for building Web APIs. Then, our web application enables domain experts to exploit containment relations in SysML models to connect diverse data sources. The outcome is an integrated GraphQL API that matches the engineering model structures by resembling views across multiple database sources. The discussed approach incorporates the benefits of data-oriented development and low-code platforms beyond the business automation domain.||

A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely. Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a digital twin of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system. A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation. This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.||
|Bocciarelli, P; D'Ambrogio, A; Panetti, T|A Model Based Framework for IoT-Aware Business Process Management|2023||FUTURE INTERNET||10.3390/fi15020050|IoT-aware Business Processes (BPs) that exchange data with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, briefly referred to as IoT-aware BPs, are gaining momentum in the BPM field. Introducing IoT technologies from the early stages of the BP development process requires dealing with the complexity and heterogeneity of such technologies at design and analysis time. This paper analyzes widely used IoT frameworks and ontologies to introduce a BPMN extension that improves the expressiveness of relevant BP modeling notations and allows an appropriate representation of IoT devices from both an architectural and a behavioral perspective. In the BP management field, the use of simulation-based approaches is recognized as an effective technology for analyzing BPs. Simulation models need to be parameterized according to relevant properties of the process under study. Unfortunately, such parameters may change during the process operational life, thus making the simulation model invalid with respect to the actual process behavior. To ease the analysis of IoT-aware BPs, this paper introduces a model-driven method for the automated development of digital twins of actual business processes. The proposed method also exploits data retrieved by IoT sensors to automatically reconfigure the simulation model, to make the digital twin continuously coherent and compliant with its actual counterpart.||

In manufacturing, digital twins can optimize production, prevent failures, and save resources. To consolidate the different approaches to digital twins in manufacturing, ISO 23247 defines the essential functional elements of a digital twin. We present a model-driven digital twin exemplar that realizes part of this standard to analyze milling processes. Our digital twin reference architecture includes a digital twin service component that manages and connects different services to adapt the manufacturing process according to a given objective. Two digital twin services, for the adaptation of component and tool conditions and for geometric error adaptation, illustrate the potential of this reference architecture. The digital twin connects to an industrial milling machine via domain-specific languages. This exemplar uses models at design time and at runtime to separate the concerns of software engineers and domain experts and leverages these models to understand and optimize the use of industrial machine tools.||
|D. Lehner|A Model-Driven Platform for Engineering Holistic Digital Twins|2023|IEEE|2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C)|https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350749|10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00045|With the combination of software and physical devices into so-called cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged to handle the resulting complexity and efficiently connect software to physical devices, the so-called physical twins (PTs). While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.||

Engineering digital twin solutions is a knowledge and effort intensive activity. In-depth knowledge of manufacturing plant, process operations, underlying physics, data, and technical problems is essential in the design of digital twin application for a given business objective. Industry domain experts, data scientists and solution developers must collaborate to build it with the required features and functionalities. Currently, it is not an easily scalable process. For each industry vertical and even for the same plant type, the development process has to be repeated manually. To address this, we present a model-driven knowledge-based approach where knowledge can be captured in a machine processible form and reasoned with, to systematically guide the solution development process. Knowledge is modelled at three levels of abstraction, namely, meta, plant type and plant instance. We describe how this helps in generalizing the knowledge, in driving the knowledge acquisition process, and in contextualizing knowledge to specific problem instances. We then outline how the captured knowledge can be exploited to guide various digital twin engineering tasks such as problem definition, model building (physics or data-driven), data preparation, algorithm selection, etc. In particular, we discuss how the approach helps in arriving at a detailed digital twin specification starting from a high-level business problem statement. We present a case study demonstrating the approach on a real-life industrial problem.  Â© 2023 IEEE.||

To support the modelling of these complex systems, multi-paradigm modelling advocates explicitly modelling every part of a system at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction. From this perspective, this exemplar paper presents an exemplary application of multi-paradigm modelling on the multi-robot warehouse system to provide architectural, behavioural and operational models. These models demonstrate how multi-paradigm modelling has been applied to model the different system parts at different levels of abstraction, applying different modelling formalisms and notations. This paper aims to provide a reference repository of the collection of models of the multi-robot warehouse case study, which can be accessed and utilized to replicate this system, conduct more future research on this case study, and extend it using other formalisms and modelling approaches.||
|Zhou, MK; Feng, DH|A New Modeling Approach for Power Grid Online Analysis|2020||IFAC PAPERSONLINE||10.1016/j.ifacol.2020.12.2503|A new modeling approach for power grid online analysis is proposed to support the realization of a new online analysis system architecture. The model-driven software development, automatic code generation, and in-memory computing techniques are employed in the modeling approach. Data source adapters are developed for the integration of the model with the existing EMS system. A large-scale power grid online network data model (similar to 40K-bus) is used for the model performance testing in a Lab environment. The proposed modeling approach was used to develop a new online analysis application, which was deployed and running in a provincial grid dispatching control center. The Lab and field performance measurement shows that the modeling approach-based application can achieve second-order end-to-end responsiveness. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.||
|Xu, CY; Li, WY; Zhao, Y|A Novel Fused NARX-Driven Digital Twin Model for Aeroengine Gas Path Parameter Prediction|2024||IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS||10.1109/TII.2023.3345462|In this article, we propose a digital twin model (DTM) based on the nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous (NARX) inputs model network to predict engine gas path parameters accurately. The DTM is combined by a model-driven model (MDM) and a data-driven model (DDM). To allocate the function of MDM and DDM, a pretreating fusion method is proposed for the first time, which is divided into three parts. First, all parameters are predicted by the MDM. Second, for the parameters with bad predictive effects, the DDM is employed to optimize them. Third, the parameters with good predictive effects and those optimized by DDM are fused to generate the DTM. The DDM is built by a two-stage NARX. Particularly, a NARX with a gate recurrent unit attention mapping function is used to improve the accuracy of the predicted parameters. The experimental results show that the maximum prediction error of the DTM is less than 5%. This implies that the fused DTM guarantees the prediction accuracy of each gas path parameter in the case of performance degradation.||

At the same time, advanced system engineering (SE) takes model-based system engineering (MBSE) as the core to realize formal modeling and process analysis of the whole system. The two complement each other and are the key technologies for the transition from 2.0 to 3.0 in the era of artificial intelligence and the transition from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence. This survey summarizes an advanced information fusion system, from model-driven to knowledge-enabled. Firstly, the concept, representative methods, key technologies and application fields of model-driven system engineering are introduced. Then, it introduces the concept of knowledge-driven knowledge engineering, summarizes the architecture and construction methods of advanced knowledge engineering and summarizes the application fields. Finally, the combination of advanced information fusion systems, development opportunities and challenges are discussed.||

Our genomes, disease histories, behavior, and lifestyles are all different; therefore it is not too surprising that people often respond differently when administered the same drugs. Cancer, in particular, is a complex and heterogeneous disease, originating in patients with different genomes, in cells with the different epigenomes, formed and evolving on the basis of random processes, with the response to therapy not only depending on the individual cancer cell but also on many features of the patient. Selection of an optimal therapy will therefore require a deep molecular analysis comprising both the patient and their tumor (e.g., comprehensive molecular tumor analysis [CMTA]), and much better personalized prediction of response to possible therapies. Currently, we are at an inflection point in which advances in technology, decreases in the costs of sequencing and other molecular analyses, and increases in computing advances are converging, forming the foundation to build a data-driven approach to personalized oncology.

German version|2019||ONKOLOGE||10.1007/s00761-019-00652-1|We are unique and so are our diseases. Our genomes, disease histories, behavior, and lifestyles are all different. It is not too surprising, therefore, that we often respond differently to the drugs we receive.

Selection of an optimal therapy will therefore require a deep molecular analysis comprising both the patient and their tumor (e.g., comprehensive molecular tumor analysis [CMTA]), and much better personalized prediction of response to possible therapies.

A high-fidelity dynamic wear model relies on the appropriate characterization and updating strategy of the tooth macro-geometry, contact parameters and dynamic load. A geometrically adaptive-loaded tooth contact analysis (GA-LTCA) method is proposed to bridge wear morphology and dynamic behaviours. The finite element method and run-to-failure test are adopted to verify the GA-LTCA method and wear prediction model, respectively. Based on the proposed wear model, the life-cycle wear characteristics and the updating strategy of wear geometry are investigated. Owing to the consideration of the micro-cycle of the contact stress and geometrical updating, the predicted wear profile exhibits a desirable agreement with experimental results. The tooth profile deviation vector should be updated more frequently than the finite element model of worn gears. Only the finite element grid of the sun-planet gear pair should be updated because the wear of the sun-planet is much more serious than that of the ring-planet. Numerical results indicate the potential of the proposed high-fidelity model for digital twin-based wear prediction and life cycle failure prognosis.||

Digital twin is expected to accurately estimate the real-time hydraulic parameters of blind spots of the pumping station system even under some adverse conditions including the interference of observation noise and model parameters drift. To solve these challenges, a digital twin framework integrating the model-driven method, control theory and data-driven method is presented. In this framework, an unsteady flow state estimation method combining frequency domain analysis and generalized predictive control theory is developed for the first time, which is superior to traditional time-domain numerical discrete methods in terms of computational efficiency and anti-noise interference. In the model parameter calibration process, the novelty concerns modeling of the optimization problem considering the dynamic operation control of the station and unsteady flow of pipelines. And this process is accomplished through the comprehensive application of the model-free adaptive control algorithm, the transient flow model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. This work is applied to a pumping station in a product pipeline to verify its effectiveness in estimating the transient flow state of data blind spots and map the dynamic operation behavior under the interference of colored noise and parameter drift.

Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.

For supporting the development of Digital Twins, several software vendors are offering dedicated tool support, often referred to as Digital Twin platforms. The modeling capabilities of these platforms are mostly concerned with structural viewpoints, i.e., providing an overview of available components including their current and historical sensor values. However, behavioral viewpoints did not yet receive much attention on these platforms. As behavioral models are often used during the design processes, e.g., for simulation and synthesis, it would be beneficial for having them included in Digital Twin platforms, e.g., for reasoning on the set of possible next actions or for checking the execution history to perform runtime validation. In this paper, we present a catalog of modeling patterns for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavioral models and their corresponding runtime information without requiring any extension of the code bases of Digital Twin platforms. We demonstrate the presented modeling patterns by applying them to the Digital Twin platform offered by Microsoft, in an additive manufacturing use case of a 3D printer in a production line.||

To solve the above problems, an updating method for knowledge in the virtual model driven by data is studied. Firstly, the behavior model in the virtual model can be divided into basic functional models such as forward kinematics, trajectory planning, and material generation, and the knowledge components to support functional model computation are constructed. Secondly, the evaluation indexes for the quality, maintainability, and reliability of the knowledge components are established, and appropriate knowledge component combinations can be selected from the knowledge component base. Then, based on the measurements, it is used to the triggering judgment, and a knowledge component combination with the smallest difference between the simulation output of the virtual model and the real data of physical entities is selected from multiple combinations to realize the iterative update of the model. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by examples.||

This technique involves the creation of a virtual version of a real object, utilizing simulation and optimization tools with real data to optimize its functioning. The traction inverter is considered the brain of the EV drive system, as it controls the power flow between the battery and the electric motor. It converts the DC voltage from the battery into AC voltage and adjusts the frequency and amplitude to control the speed and torque of the motor. This research work presents the DT modelling procedures of an EV traction inverter. The basic principles of DT are discussed, and the model-driven DT modelling technique is compared to the data-driven. The motor-drive physical model (test bench) is provided. A data-driven model of the inverter was generated using a nonlinear regression-based artificial neural network ANN. Historical data from experimental tests were used as a modeling reference.

Driven by data and simulators, the digital twin can create the virtual twins of physical objects to perform monitoring, simulation, prediction, optimization, and so on. Hence, the application of digital twin can increase efficiency and security of systems by providing reliable model and decision supports. In this paper, we propose a state-aware model learning method to simulate and analyze the lightweight protocol implementations in edge/cloud environments. We introduce the data flow of program execution and network interaction inputs/outputs (I/O) into the extended finite state machine (EFSM) to expand the modeling scope and insight. We aim to calibrate the states and construct an accurate state-machine model using a digital twin based layered approach to reasonably reflect the correlation of a device's external behavior and internal data. This, in turn, improves our ability to verify the logic and evaluate the security for protocol implementations. This method firstly involves instrumenting the target device to monitor variable activity during its execution. We then employ learning algorithms to produce multiple rounds of message queries. Both the I/O data corresponding to these query sequences and the state calibration information derived from filtered memory variables are obtained through the mapper and execution monitor, respectively. These two aspects of information are combined to dynamically and incrementally construct the protocol's state machine. We apply this method to develop SALearn and evaluate the effectiveness of SALearn on two lightweight protocol implementations. Our experimental results indicate that SALearn outperforms existing protocol model learning tools, achieving higher learning efficiency and uncovering more interesting states and security issues. In total, we identified two violation scenarios of rekey logic. These situations also reflect the differences in details between different implementations.||

In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-To-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology. In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework.

Just as with textual languages, the concrete syntax is the representation of the language elements intended for humans and thus has a decisive influence on the comprehensibility and usability of the language.The concrete syntax of GLML is often defined less precisely or in less detail when designing metamodels. While metamodels can be designed independently or even without concrete syntax, the latter is required for the actual usage of a graphical language. The layout and the interaction support for editing the language elements are commonly delegated to tool development. However, the development of modeling tools focuses on functionality such as model transformation and model execution, disregarding usability and handling. Low user acceptance then leads to niche applications and a limited number of users. The main reason for the lack of support for laying out and editing the language elements are complex integration challenges mainly concerning the development or adaptation of suitable layout procedures for GLML.Some frameworks offer a remedy by providing layout procedures for GLML. However, GLML differ from each other concerning their concrete syntax. Even minor differences in the concrete syntax of two languages can make the desirransferable or only transferable through complex adaptations. Formal methods for matching the concrete syntax of a GLML with existing layout procedures as early as during the development of the language are missing.In this paper, we present a classification scheme for layout procedures for GLML. The classification scheme is based on a classification scheme we developed for the concrete syntax of GLML, and it contains significant features. We define a mapping procedure between the two classifiers. As a result, the mapping decides whether a layout procedure can be used for a GLML. Both the classification scheme and the process of mapping are demonstrated in a real-world example of a technical graphical domain-specific modeling language.The presented approach supports the design of GLML and the tool development for GLML. It can be an important step towards automated tool development.|layout-algorithm reuse, graph-like modeling languages, designing and implementing modeling languages, concrete syntax of modeling languages|MODELS '22

Therefore, universities must integrate the development of Digital Twins into their educational program to enable future engineers to overcome the challenges concomitant with Digital Twins. While a theoretical basis for Digital Twins is crucial e.g., hardware-software integration, Internet of Things (IoT) or simulation models, a practical combination of these heterogeneous components is also necessary to introduce the Digital Twin as a whole concept. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) an approach was introduced to grasp complexity by using system models e.g., through SysML diagrams. Digital Twins are an example for advanced systems shaped by high complexity. The usage of system models is therefore likely.

First, the parameters of the double Wiebe functions are calculated by the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA), and the operating parameters and Wiebe parameters are used as input and output parameters of neural networks, respectively, to construct parameter identification models. Then, the combustion process is simplified and reconstructed by combining the Wiebe function with the deep learning neural network, and a 0-D prediction model based on the hybrid model-driven and data-driven method is established, which can further obtain combustion results such as cylinder pressure curve and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). The results show that the coefficient of determination (R-2) value of the dual-fuel engine 0-D prediction model based on the double Wiebe function combined with POA-CNN-Bi-LSTM is 0.9827, and the model has good prediction accuracy and generalization. The development of the combustion model provides reliable numerical model support for the online evaluation and optimization of dual-fuel engine performance.||

This study presents a zero-dimensional (0-D) prediction model that integrates the advantages of model-driven and data-driven approaches. Initially, the snake optimization algorithm (SO) is employed to address the challenges related to low parameter fitting accuracy and multiple solutions in calculating Wiebe parameters. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (CNN-Bi-LSTM) is devised to establish a nonlinear correlation between operating parameters and Wiebe parameters. The structural parameters of CNN-Bi-LSTM are then optimized using the SO algorithm (SO-CNN-Bi-LSTM). Ultimately, a 0-D prediction combustion model is formulated by amalgamating the Wiebe function with the neural network, enabling real-time prediction of combustion results and generalization analysis of prediction performance under non-calibrated conditions. The findings demonstrate that the combustion model exhibits heightened accuracy, thereby establishing a robust technical foundation for the development of a digital twin in the engine combustion process.||

The conceived digital twin allows for several functions that are unexplored in literature so far: the combination of design time analysis with explainability, use of state-space prediction bounded by likelihood, and explanation of non-applicability. This is achieved through a digital twin performing three main activities:1) The predicting activity predicts system performance along several potential paths.2) The planning activity analyzes reconfiguration rules and predicted system behavior to produce reconfiguration plans that try to optimally utilize available resources and achieve all SLOs without unintended interactions between the execution of rules.3) The explaining activity processes all artifacts produced during system simulation time or runtime to provide comprehensive visualizations to developers.We explain how each activity is performed and what models it processes and produces based on a running example.|self-adaptive system, reconfiguration coordination, palladio, explainability, digital twin, cyber-cyber digital twin|MODELS '22

Consequently, management strategies are not tailored to human needs and are inadequate in providing transportation intelligence. This article investigates a management architecture based on decentralized/distributed autonomous operations/organizations (DAOs) that considers both the technical and societal aspects in our transportation metaverse, TransVerse. This design maps people's transportation needs in physical space to their digital counterparts in cyberspace, utilizing blockchain technology to guarantee the secure exchange of information and ultimately bring about the Internet of Minds (IoM). With the federated intelligence that emerged in IoM, we can devise reliable and prompt traffic decisions by incorporating consensus, community voting, and smart contracts into the organizational, coordination, and execution structure. Details on operational procedures and key technologies are also covered. To demonstrate the efficacy of DAOs-based management, a case study of world model-driven cooperative signal control is provided, indicating its promising application in future transportation management.||

The stray light received by the spaceborne telescope in the space environment will be one of the most important factors affecting its performance. The optical mechanical surface of spaceborne telescope will deviate from the original design due to various objective factors during the whole link process, and the actual optical mechanical surface is not ideal. In order to ensure that it can work normally, it is necessary to simulate and analyze the stray light situation of the whole link. This paper mainly introduces the complex environment and complex characteristics experienced from the ground section to the orbit section, analyzes and summarizes the sources of stray light, and finally proposes a framework for establishing a digital twin model of stray light for spaceborne telescopes.

Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis. We also demonstrate that our digital twins framework can accurately predict driver behaviors and effectively prevent collisions using a case study in a virtual driving simulation environment.||

First, a three-dimensional geometric model of the power transformer is built based on ANSYS Maxwell platform, including the iron core, windings, etc. Then, a digital model of the characteristic parameterization of the transformer in the digital space is established. The electromagnetic field and the temperature field based on ANSYS Workbench platform are coupled. Also, The temperature distribution of the air-immersed transformer core-winding module under six typical different working conditions is studied, and the hot spot location and temperature distribution rule under different working conditions are obtained. The simulation results of magnetic flux density, voltage and current under different operating conditions, losses and theoretical values show that the proposed DT model can effectively reflect the physical mechanism of the transformer. In addition, the simulated results show that the iron core temperature does not rise with the increase of the load rate and the winding temperature rises with the increase of the load rate.

Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling & Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socio-economic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making.

In the general framework presented in this work, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection. We specifically investigate the application of the proposed framework to a simple case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. The Bayesian model trained at the DT has the key advantage of capturing epistemic uncertainty regarding the communication system, e.g., regarding current traffic conditions, which arise from limited PT-to-DT data transfer. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.  Â© 2023 IEEE.||

Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-Target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-The-Art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-Target tracking scenes.

Current approaches for sustainability assessment of software are either only focused on their operation or rely on methods in their engineering. More holistic approaches for sustainable software system spanning are missing. Thus, we are interested in the engineering of sustainable software systems together with the monitoring of their sustainability goals over their whole lifetime. Within this paper, we suggest using digital twins to accompany software systems in all life cycle phases with a specific focus on using model-driven engineering methods for the creation of applications. We can generate accompanying digital twins which share relevant models and data with the actual system and provide services for the assessment of sustainability indicators. In the long run, this provides us with better assessment options for software systems.||

It is the concept of creating a virtual equivalent of a real-world object that exists parallelly in the real world. With the application of real-world data, a computer program can create a simulated model that can predict or understand the working of a product or a process that may not even be present in the physical world. In short, digital twinning is a digital equivalent of any real-world object, phenomenon, or utility. A digital twin is a model driven by the Internet of Things application and it can be employed to assess the current status of the object in concern and also to forecast its future condition, controlling the behavior and optimizing its performance. Digital Twins Technology has already found its applications in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, automobile, retailing, restaurant management, smart cities, etc. This paper brings a brief insight into this emerging technology, its importance, where it can be employed and its scope in the future.

Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis. We also demonstrate that our digital twins framework can accurately predict driver behaviors and effectively prevent collisions using a case study in a virtual driving simulation environment.

Current practices in decision-making are predominantly intuition-driven with attendant challenges for precision and rigor. We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling & Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss the rigor of our validation of the proposed approach and associated technology infrastructure through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.|simulatable model, digital twin, decision making, agent model|MODELS '22

To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%.

Currently, this process is highly reliant upon manual inputs, needing 10 times more labour hours than scanning the physical asset. The resulting modelling cost counteracts the expected benefits of the digital twin. We tackle this challenge using a novel model-driven method that exploits the highly regulated and standardised nature of railways. It starts by restricting the search for OLE elements relative to point clusters of the railway masts. The resulting point clusters of the OLE elements are then converged with various parametric models of different catenary configurations to verify the presence of OLE elements and to find the best possible fit. The method outputs a geometry-only digital twin of the OLE system in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The method was tested on an 18 km railway point cloud and achieves overall detection rates of 93.2% F1 score for OLE cables and 98.1% F1 score for other OLE elements. The accuracy of the generated model is evaluated using distance-based metrics between the ground truth model and the automated model. The average modelling distance is 3.82 cm Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for all 18 km data.

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.  Â© 2023 IEEE.||

CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems. Â© 2023, The Author(s).||

Model-based engineering (MBE) is a kind of digital engineering combining product lifecycle management and model-based systems engineering approaches. The abstract syntax defines the model elements and the structure of the modeling language. The system model must provide different views for the different stakeholder concerns. Typically, at least one view is a text document. Other views could be, for example, a set of SysML diagrams, or spreadsheets, or slide presentations. Model Driven Architecture defines three model levels: computational-independent model, platform-independent model, and platform-specific model.

AI-assisted energy saving is one of the potential self-organizing network use cases for radio access network intelli-gence that can be used to predict the service load. This prediction can in turn be leveraged for proactively turning OFF/ON the capacity booster small cells within the coverage of always ON macro cells. These ML workloads can reside in macro cell base stations as opposed to conventional cloud-centric architecture to meet beyond 5G ambitious requirements of ultra-low latency, highest reliability, and scalability. However, the power-hungry hyperparameter search of ML workloads distributed at edges of the radio access network is a major challenge that can have substantial effect on the overall energy -efficiency of the network. In this paper, we illustrate how coordinated efficient training of distributed edge- ML models driven energy saving functions can enhance network energy efficiency. We validate the proposed method through a data-driven simulation methodology augmenting real traffic traces and comparing it with variants of legacy edge-ML hyper-parameter search techniques.||

New concepts, such as Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Software-Defined Manufacturing, IoT, and rapid development of AI require the changes in the education of the future engineers, especially IT specialist responsible for the software part of industrial robots. This paper presents two connected robotics education factories aimed at teaching key concepts in robotics, artificial intelligence, human-robot interaction, Internet of Things (IoT), digital twins, model-driven software engineering, and risk analysis. The factories serve as an educational platform for students and professionals alike, enabling them to learn practical experience in designing, developing, and testing robotics software engineering methods in a safe and controlled environment. The factories are equipped with multiple sensors, actuators, and controllers that facilitate the integration of different technologies, enabling learners to work on scenarios that simulate real-world industrial processes. This paper introduces (i) seven educational goals that are crucial for modern and future robotic software engineers, (ii) architectures of the model factories and their components, and (iii) the underlying pedagogical approach, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of the factories to foster innovation and drive economic growth by equipping learners with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the digital economy.||

This situation is exacerbated when the System under Monitoring (SuM) evolves, requiring changes in the monitoring platform. Most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for dealing with system evolution. In this paper, we present GRuM (Generating CPS Runtime Monitors), a framework that combines model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring, to automatically generate a customized monitoring platform for a given SuM. Relevant properties are captured in a Domain Model Fragment, and changes to the SuM can be easily accommodated by automatically regenerating the platform code. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance we evaluated GRuM against two different systems using TurtleBot robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Results show that GRuM facilitates the creation and evolution of a runtime monitoring platform with little effort and that the platform can handle a substantial amount of events and data.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

However, there remains disagreement about the precise definition of a DT and the essential characteristics in the DT paradigm, such as the scope of the system-under-study and the time-scale of its communication with the DT. These experience reports could therefore be hampering further classification and research insights by not reporting all of these relevant details about the DT solutions. We address these concerns by providing a conceptual structure for DTs as a common understanding and checklist for researchers and practitioners to precisely describe the characteristics and capabilities of their DT solutions. We express five experience reports using our structure to demonstrate its applicability and role as a guideline to improve the reporting of characteristics and increase the clarity of future experience reports.||

Those connections are essential to the complete system, as they enable external systems to react to changes in the internal model and vice versa. In our case, the model is based on Relational Reference Attribute Grammars, an extension of Attribute Grammars to enable conceptual models at runtime while retaining their benefits of modular specification and an incremental evaluation scheme. We present an approach to enable concise specification of the causal connection and needed transformations to match required formats or semantics. To show its applicability, a case study showing the coordination of multiple industrial robot arms using models is presented. We show that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.

Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS.

To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system's development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.

Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients' engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients' care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists' collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients' quality of life.||

In this article, we present a novel approach to design and control smart manufacturing systems. The approach is reactive, that is responds to unplanned situations and implements an iterative refinement technique, that is, optimizes itself during runtime to better accommodate production goals. For realizing these advances, we present a model-driven methodology and we provide a prototypical implementation of such a production system. In particular, we employ Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as our artificial intelligence environment for automated planning of production processes and combine it with one of the most prominent Industry 4.0 standards for the fundamental production system model: IEC 62264. We show how to plan the assembly of small trucks from available components and how to assign specific production operations to available production resources, including robotic manipulators and transportation system shuttles. Results of the evaluation indicate that the presented approach is feasible and that it is able to significantly strengthen the flexibility of production systems during runtime. Note to Practitionersâ€”Smart production is an umbrella for a number of shifts and initiatives that deal with digitization of manufacturing/production systems and related issues and potentials. In this work, we present an approach for utilizing automated planning for creating production plans. This is in contrast to the traditional approach, where recipes are programmed into the production system ahead-of-time. However, automated planning relies on specific languages and tools that are hard to master by nonexperts, which is a factor that strongly limited the utilization of plan-driven approaches for industrial automation in practice. Thus, we propose to generate planning tasks automatically with model-driven engineering techniques. We are utilizing the industrial standard IEC 62264 for the description of the production system, and the academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for planning. PDDL is handled completely transparent to the user, that is the user is shielded from its complexity by employing the IEC 62264 model as the sole frontend.||

Primary issues in this area stem from the absence of standardization and the complexity and heterogeneity inherent to the IoT landscape. Model-Driven Development (MDD) is considered an effective technique for IoT application development. We argue that there is a need for methodologies of MDD that encompass system development and integration, as well as organizational aspects. To compensate for this lack, this work introduces MIoTA (Modeling IoT Applications for Air Conditioning Facilities), a modeling method supporting IoT application development in the field of air conditioning facilities. The ADOxx-based MIoTA tool was developed in an industrial use case. It contains a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) and various functionalities to support the modeling and development processes, so no specific IT skills are required at the application level.

We used Elsevierâ€™s Scopus database to find relevant publications from January 2018 to December 2022. Using publication citation ranking and other factors (e.g., publication venues), we selected 110 articles and then analyzed them using BibExcel and VOSviewer software tools. With a modest decline in 2021, this analysis shows an overall increase in publications during the time period. A thematic analysis of the abstracts revealed a strong focus on the introduction of reference architectures and integration of MBSE with business and management methodologies like Agile and BPMN 2.0. Model-driven engineering and machine learning techniques are essential among the enablers for realization of complex heterogeneous IoT systems in the realm of Industry 4.0. We highlight these findings to better understand and meet the enduring challenge of scaling MBSE of IoT across diverse sectors like health, manufacturing, and transportation.||

Since there is no practical way to instantaneously measure it at run time, a model is required for its estimation. Recently, several data-driven SOH models have been proposed, whose accuracy heavily relies on the quality of the datasets used for their training. Since these datasets are obtained from measurements, they are limited in the variety of the charge/discharge profiles. To address this scarcity issue, we propose generating datasets by simulating a traditional battery model (e.g., a circuit-equivalent one). The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to use a simulatable battery model to evaluate a potentially infinite number of workload profiles for training the data-driven model. Furthermore, this general concept can be applied using any simulatable battery model, providing a fine spectrum of accuracy/complexity tradeoffs. Our results indicate that using simulated data achieves reasonable accuracy in SOH estimation, with a 7.2% error relative to the simulated model, in exchange for a 27X memory reduction and a approximate to 2000X speedup.||

Nevertheless, tackling the orchestration of these complex ecosystems has become a challenging problem. Specially the inherent entanglement of the different emerging technologies makes it hard to maintain and scale such ecosystems. In this context, the usage of model-driven engineering as a more abstract form of glue-code, replacing the boilerplate fashion, has improved the software development lifecycle, democratising the access to and use of the aforementioned technologies. In this paper, we present a practical use case in the context of Smart Manufacturing, where we use several platforms as providers of a high-level abstraction layer, as well as security measures, allowing a more efficient system construction and interoperability.

Such Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) produce large amounts of data, which can be used to analyze the systemâ€™s state and optimize its operation. To enable this analysis, the respective software components need to be interoperable with the CPPSs. While standards, such as OPC UA, provide interoperability on a technical protocol level, we see a vastly heterogeneous landscape of data models. Therefore, the integration of analysis components with their underlying CPPS is usually a laborious, manual process, also discouraging reuse. To facilitate the reuse of analysis software in this setting, we propose a model-driven method for integration with the underlying CPPS and the consumers of analysis results. Our contribution consists of (i) domain-specific languages for semantically enriched interface descriptions and simple mappings, (ii) a code generator toolchain to realize the specified mappings, and (iii) a simple, loosely coupled architecture for the resulting system.||

Conventional approaches of devising and testing microgrid control functions involve higher level of complexity and requires extensive expert engineering effort. This paper presents a model-driven microgrid control approach that significantly simplifies the process of development and testing of microgrid control functions as well as performing microgrid feasibility study. A case study is presented here in which the proposed controller is applied to provide four main functions, including: 1- Control power at the microgrid point of common coupling, 2- Dispatch energy storage to minimize the cost of importing power, 3- Smooth the profile of aggregated power of renewable and energy storage, and 4- Devise load shedding strategy.||

Industrial SysPE state of practice is generally model-based. Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of systems, there is a need to develop and establish model-driven methods and techniques. To structure the field of SysPE, we identify (1) industrial challenges motivating the importance of SysPE, (2) scientific challenges that need to be addressed to establish model-driven SysPE, (3) important focus areas for SysPE and (4) best practices. We conducted a survey to collect feedback on our views. The responses were used to update and validate the identified challenges, focus areas, and best practices. The final result is presented in this paper. Interesting observations are that industry sees a need for better design-space exploration support, more than for additional performance modeling and analysis techniques. Also tools and integral methods for SysPE need attention. From the identified focus areas, scheduling and supervisory control is seen as lacking established best practices.||

As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development.||
|Sartaj, H; Ali, S; Yue, T; Moberg, K|Model-based digital twins of medicine dispensers for healthcare IoT applications|2024||SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE||10.1002/spe.3311|Healthcare applications with the Internet of Things (IoT) are often safety-critical, thus, require extensive testing. Such applications are often connected to smart medical devices from various vendors. System-level testing of such applications requires test infrastructures physically integrating medical devices, which is time and monetary-wise expensive. Moreover, applications continuously evolve, for example, introducing new devices and users and updating software. Nevertheless, a test infrastructure enabling testing with a few devices is insufficient for testing healthcare IoT systems, hence compromising their dependability. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach for the creation and operation of digital twins (DTs) of medicine dispensers as a replacement for physical devices to support the automated testing of IoT applications at scale. We evaluate our approach with an industrial IoT system with medicine dispensers in the context of Oslo City and its industrial partners, providing healthcare services to its residents. We study the fidelity of DTs in terms of their functional similarities with their physical counterparts: medicine dispensers. Results show that the DTs behave more than 92% similar to the physical medicine dispensers, providing a faithful replacement for the dispenser.||

The rising number of dynamically interconnected elements leads to an increasing complexity in such systems, which accompanies new challenges during systems engineering and thus leads to reaching the limits of contemporary methods. While the community has recognized this, new approaches recently arose to find solutions for particular parts of this problem. However, as the need for a holistic approach emerges, the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been standardized as a promising framework. While this domain-specific architecture framework is missing specifications to address all aspects of such critical infrastructure, this paper thus proposes a new modeling methodology promoting model-driven engineering (MDE) of current or future production systems based on the peculiarities of RAMI 4.0. To enable mutual architecture development across the entire system hierarchy and all stakeholders, the aspects of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) are considered. The proposed step-by-step guideline is thereby made applicable by a modeling framework called RAMI Toolbox that ensures the engineering of both greenfield and brownfield systems. Finally, the approach, including all artifacts, is evaluated based on a real-world case study proposed by Siemens.||

UDTs model city aspects such as transportation, water supply or air pollution, together with their inherent complexity. For addressing this complexity, in this paper we propose the use of models distributed over the Cloud-to-Thing Continuum, in order to take advantage of the flexibility, scalability and computational capacity of digital services through the multiple physical infrastructures offered by this environment. Following this philosophy, we have modelled a distributed digital twin of the public bus service of the city of Malaga and the users who travel on it. We have validated the model against the real system using the USE tool, and used it to perform simulations and inferences. Â© 20023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Firstly, the geometric model of the robot is constructed based on the physical space. Secondly, the constraints and physical characteristics of the robot's physical model are determined using the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) method. Then, the kinematic model is built based on the D-H parameters provided by the physical model to determine the behavioral model. Finally, an experimental platform is established with a virtual space update rate of 100 Hz, and trajectory verification is conducted, with relative position errors of 0.34%, 0.41%, and 0.22% for the X, Y, and Z axes respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of this method in digital twin systems.  Â© 2023 IEEE.||

Subsystem models are created by various engineering design tools. During the design process there exists an extraordinary amount of generated data resulting from created models, simulation, and engine field tests. This data can be leveraged by artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning to help accelerate the exploration of the large design spaces existing in the complex system of a gas engine. This paper presents a vision and road map of integrating such AIs and preliminary ideas on relevant AI models for such use cases. We explore increasing the realistic nature of existing simulations, approximating simulations to avoid excess computation, and cumulative effect modeling.||

Digital twins are made possible using various technologies such as Internet of Things, sensor technology, artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning. With this, it represents a new stage in smart systems engineering. Developing digital twin-based systems necessitates a holistic system engineering approach in which modeling is critical. Various studies have been published on the notion of digital twins and its applications in various domains, but a modeling perspective has not been explicitly considered. Hence, this article provides a novel insight on the notion of digital twins from a modeling perspective, describing the evolution of modeling in engineering and likewise providing a rational basis for digital twins as a next logical step in modeling. A metamodel is provided that integrates the key concepts of systems engineering, digital twins, and modeling. While elaborating on the existing evolution of modeling in engineering, it is stated that the next step of digital twins will be artificial twins. Â© 2022 by the author.||

The use of digital twins allows modeling in virtual space for various IES configurations. As a result, an optimal option of IES is obtained, which is implemented in the construction or expansion of a real-world IES. The paper proposes the principles of building digital twins for solving the IES design problems. The paper presents a new methodological approach developed by the authors to design an IES with the help of its digital twin. This approach includes the following components: the architecture of the software platform to create digital twins, a set of technologies and tools to implement the platform, methods to automatically construct a digital twin based on the Model-Driven Engineering concept, an algorithm to design an IES based on its digital twin, and principles to organize a computational process using a multi-agent approach. The results of the computational experiment using the software implementation of the IES digital twin components are presented for a test energy supply scheme.||

The miscellaneous IIoT sensors deployed for DSM are distributed and operate in a hierarchical and federated structure. Nonetheless, fulfilling essential quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as ensuring security and privacy (integrity) while maintaining scalability and interoperability (robustness), poses a profound challenge for the DSM cloud service platform. Although blockchain technologies have been used to safeguard integrity, the first two generations have imposed constraints on robustness. In contrast, the third-generation blockchain, a.k.a. decentralized crosschain ecosystem, complements Web 3.0 and metaverse and can mitigate the constraints of previous generations. Moreover, blockchain-based ad hoc solutions for DSM use cases are abundant; they often suffer from limited adaptability and unique or homogeneous use cases from a software engineering perspective. A holistic architectural modeling process (AMP) leading to a software reference architecture (SRA) is preferred when alleviating ad hoc constraints. Therefore, we proposed an AMP for SRA for crosschain-based DSM that safeguards integrity while preserving robustness. In the work described in this article, we have conducted the following systemâ€”modeling process. First, we propose a novel software AMP for DSM. Second, we deduce a modeled SRA based on a crosschain. Third, we infer a modeled system architecture (SA). Empirical experiment results demonstrate that our proposed crosschain-based method outperforms the widely used on-chain-based method while achieving our objectives efficiently.||

These models are specified using dedicated, oftentimes graphical modeling languages. This includes general purpose languages such as SysML or UML which may be tailored to specific domains, and domain-specific languages with a much narrower scope. Either way, the specification of graphical modeling languages and the construction of MDE environments supporting these languages is centered on the definition of a meta-model. Meta-models capture the relevant domain abstractions and concepts by specifying the abstract syntax and static semantics of a graphical modeling language, while the concrete syntax definition, layouting principles and user interactions for model editing are only superficially addressed. This observation holds both for the current state-of-practice and the academic literature, and is at odds with the domain studied in this paper, namely the graphical modeling of real-world technical systems. Our practical observation and central hypothesis is that, in this domain, human factors should be primary concern for the design of domain-specific languages and environments, which enable domain experts to understand, create and edit their models much more efficiently and effectively. As basis for further discussion at the workshop, we report on our ongoing work to develop a technical approach and research methodology to validate this hypothesis in future empirical studies.||

A particular challenge in this context is insufficient guidance for operators on how to resolve issues and adapt their actions to a new production context. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can help to identify and address likely causes of production quality issues. However, FMEA models are typically (i) isolated from engineering domain models on product, process and resource (PPR) concerns, and (ii) not actionable for operators. This paper introduces the FMEA-to-Operation (F2O) approach to reduce the risk of ramp-up delays and recurring quality issues by integrating the required domain knowledge for model-driven, machine skill-centric, and actionable process FMEA. The F2O approach (i) validates likely root causes of a production quality issue by linking these causes to engineering reality in a graph database, and (ii) derives operation checklists with prioritized countermeasures. In a feasibility study on a real-world welding cell for car parts, we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the F2O approach. Results indicate that the F2O approach is feasible and effective, and provides operators with actionable, context-specific guidelines that are well grounded in engineering models.||

This requires highly adaptive, versatile cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs), which react flexibly to changes and perform crucial adjustments. Self-adaptive digital twins (DTs) enable adaptability through monitoring the behavior of a CPPS, identifying problems, and determining adjustments for the optimization of processes. DTs work with an idealized representation of the CPPS. Changes in system behavior that negatively impact the process execution, e.g., caused by tool wear or variations of environmental influences, and, thus, the quality of the resulting product, are ignored. This ignorance leads to defective products, sub-optimal product quality, and hazardous CPPS states. To mitigate this, we present an approach to incorporate quality awareness into a model-driven reference architecture of a self-adaptive DT. The devised concept automatically analyzes and optimizes system behavior. To this end, a component for quality evaluation extends the reference architecture. The DT and CPPS are connected via OPC UA. To validate the approach, a fiber laser machine is utilized. The DT can operate both on a physical and a virtual laser machine. Â© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are useful to urban areas in the Philippines through diversified applications: urban planning, disaster mitigation, environmental monitoring, and policy making. This study explored the use of free and open-source software to generate an LOD1 and LOD2 3D city model of Tanauan City, Batangas using building footprints from OpenStreetMap and elevation models from Taal Open LiDAR data. The proposed approach consists of GIS-based methods including data pre-processing, building height extraction, roof identification, building reconstruction, and visualization. The study adopted methods from previous studies for building detection and from Zheng et al. (2017) for LOD2 building reconstruction. For LOD1, a decision tree classifier was devised to determine the appropriate height for building extrusion. For LOD2, a model-driven approach using multipatch surfaces was utilized for building reconstruction. The workflow was able to reconstruct 70.66% LOD1 building models and 55.87% LOD2 building models with 44.37% overall accuracy. The RMSE and MAE between the extracted heights from the workflow and from manual digitization has an accuracy lower than 1â€‰m which was within the standards of CityGML. The processing time in test bench 1 and test bench 2 for LOD1 took 00:12:54.5 and 00:09:27.2 while LOD2 took 02:50:29.1 and 01:27:48.2, respectively. The results suggest that the efficient generation of LOD1 and LOD2 3D city models from open data can be achieved in the FOSS environment using less computationally intensive GIS-based algorithms.

The simulation methods are classified as model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods. In addition, simulation methods in these three industries are studied from the phases of design, manufacturing, and operation. The similarities, differences and characteristics of the simulation methods applied to the automotive, aviation and maritime industries are discussed and summarized from several aspects. Model-driven approaches are used more frequently than the other two methods in design and manufacturing phases, while hybrid methods have great potential to support different operations of DT-related studies in the reviewed three industries. In addition, issues of prognostics and health management (PHM) such as fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) has recently been more inclined to be studied using data-driven approaches. According to our analysis we believe that as DT technology evolves, the hybrid approach will become the mainstream strategy for DT-based modeling.||

However, the development of DTs pose significant challenges, particularly on the modeling and data management aspects. This paper presents a holistic approach to develop a DT implementation using a domain model derived from the standard SSN/SOSA ontologies. The proposed approach leverages the MERODE modeling method for rapid prototyping and validation, guaranteeing robust model quality checks and enabling the creation of flexible and reusable code adaptable to different architectural settings. Data management is enhanced through the use of the SOSA/SSN ontology, enabling semantic data models and inference strategies to achieve semantic interoperability. By combining MERODE and IoT ontologies, our approach aims to take a step forward in addressing the challenges linked to system complexity and data management in the development of DT.

|Laukotka, FN; Krause, D|Supporting Digital Twins for the Retrofit in Aviation by a Model-Driven Data Handling|2023||SYSTEMS||10.3390/systems11030142|Aviation is characterized by many stakeholders, long lifespans of its assets, and high requirements regarding safety, security, and documentation. To meet these requirements as well as customer needs, aircraft are regularly retrofitted with new cabins. During the planning and execution of this cabin retrofit, handling the needed and available data poses a challenge to the engineers. While much of the required data is available in some form, generally there is a lack of a digitally usable dataset of the specific aircraft-a virtual representation of the physical asset is missing. To support the implementation of such a digital twin and, thus, the overall process of retrofitting aircraft, an approach to model-driven data handling tailored to the unique circumstances and requirements of aviation is introduced. The methodology consists of a combination of systems engineering and data science techniques framed by an overarching procedure that iteratively creates and enhances a digitally accessible dataset of the relevant data, hence supporting the retrofit engineers by easing access to needed information. Besides the presentation of the research background and the methodology, a simplified example is shown, demonstrating the approach using abstracted but realistic information provided by partners from the industry.||

Closely related to this topic arises the concept of Digital Twin, which is a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes that connect to the physical counterpart to represent, simulate, or predict changes in the physical system. There are many works that focus on supporting the high-fidelity implementation of Digital Twins for specific physical devices. However, few of them consider the process as a real-world entity to be integrated into the Digital Twin. In this work, we present a microservice architecture to support the implementation of Digital Twins for IoT-Enhanced Business Processes, considering not only the physical devices but also the process itself and the relationship among them. This architectural solution is supported by a model-driven development approach, which proposes (1) the construction of a BPMN model to represent an IoT-enhanced Business Process and (2) the application of model transformation to automatically generate both Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) models and microservice Java code templates. DTDL models are used in the implementation of the Digital Twins for the IoT-Enhanced Business Process. Java code templates are used to facilitate the implementation of the microservices required to deploy the IoT-enhanced Business Process and its Digital Twins into the proposed architecture and maintain the digital and physical parts synchronised.

However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.||

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) help them to bridge the conceptual gap between the problem and the solution domain. Engineering these languages is complex, as it requires comprehensive white-box knowledge of constituents of DSLs, i.e., syntax and semantics, and their composition and realization in respective technological spaces of language workbenches. For efficient language engineering reusing existing languages by composition is essential. For this purpose, various language composition and variability mechanisms have been developed. However, in the literature, there exists no approach enabling systematic language reuse holistically, i.e., including syntax and semantics, in a black-box fashion. We propose an approach for the systematic component-oriented reuse of DSLs (SCOLaR) that supports the integrated reuse of syntax, well-formedness rules, and semantics via black-box language components that are composable along their interface in a language family. We implemented a prototypical version of our solution with the MontiCore language workbench, that supports embedding and aggregation of grammar-based languages with translational semantics realized with code-generators. In the future, we plan to improve our implementation with the support of other language workbenches and to provide a comprehensive evaluation with a series of case studies. With our work, we aim to advance the field of software language engineering by providing a novel method for black-box language reuse capturing syntax and semantics definitions for textual external, translational DSLs. This paper outlines our approach by stating the problem, motivating our research question, and proposing our solution, our plan for evaluation, and presenting expected contributions.||

The cyber-physical system (CPS) has the property of intellectuality, scalability, adaptability, and openness, making it suitable for machine tool monitoring. The current data-driven CPS method is prone to interpretability and generalization limitations due to the empirical selection of hyper-parameters in the model and the need for heterogeneous data. On the other hand, traditional model-driven systems are difficult to adjust models to practical working conditions data due to empirical equations constructed by offline data. This article proposes a novel model-driven cyber-physical system (MDCPS) to overcome these weaknesses. First, the physical model generates a counterpart of the machining process to form a cyber world, and sensors depict the real-time state of the machining process to form a physical world. Second, for deep fusion between the cyber and physical worlds, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach is applied to calibrate the empirical model with online measured data. Third, the model-based diagnosis and prediction methods are used for online monitoring and control. Case studies of MDCPS for machining monitoring are presented to prove the feasibility of this model-driven system.||

The recent interest in the DT networks is fueled by the emergence of novel wireless technologies and use-cases that exacerbate the level of complexity to orchestrate the network and to manage its resources. Driven by AI, the key principle of the DT is to create a virtual twin for the physical entities and network dynamics where the virtual twin will be leveraged to generate synthetic data and offer an on-demand platform for AI model training. Despite the common understanding that AI is the seed for DT, we anticipate that the DT and AI will be enablers for each other in a way that overcomes their limitations and complements each others' benefits. In this article, we dig into the fundamentals of DT, where we reveal the role of DT in unifying model- and data-driven approaches, and explore the opportunities offered by DT in order to achieve the optimistic vision of 6G networks. We further unfold the essential role of the theoretical underpinnings in unlocking further opportunities by AI, and hence, we unveil their pivotal impact on the realization of reliable, efficient, and low-latency DT.||

These topics are widely discussed and are regarded with a high significance for enterprises all over the globe. Paperless factories however, are still unspecified in literature and enterprises face a challenge in finding a guideline in how to implement paperless factories. In this paper, we specify the characteristics of a paperless factory, the differentiation to a smart factory and propose a guideline for transitioning a document-based factory organization and control to a model-based one. The guideline is implemented in two teaching modules. These modules are the content of seminars, workshops, and consultation projects for the board of management, production supervisors, project leaders, and external consultants who are in charge of leading paper-based factories to partly or fully paperless factories.||

By raising the level of abstraction beyond code through visual programming and model-driven development, a Low-Code Development Platform (LCDP) provides the tools to create software using the low-code approach. LCDPs typically support specific application types and domains such as web applications, mobile applications, data analytics platforms and dashboards. While some LCDPs exist for control systems in the manufacturing industry, this domain is not yet fully supported. In this paper, we present a multiple-case study based on five interviews to explore the role LCDPs can play in industrial automation. In particular, we investigate which use cases are considered relevant for LCDPs and what the actual requirements for such platforms are from an industrial perspective. Our results show that many different manufacturing use cases could be implemented by or already benefit from LCDPs. However, successful future LCDPs must meet certain industry-specific requirements.||

Aero-engine is a typical complex equipment. The accurate monitoring in operation and performance degradation assessment and prediction are the key problems in maintenance. According to the definition of digital, the paper puts forward the concept of aero-engine digital twin and constructs an aero-engine digital twin model based on precise physical models, historical data and sensors data. The aero-engine digital twin model can predict the physical properties and can be applied to accurate monitoring in operation and performance degradation assessment and prediction. Â© 2021 IEEE.||

The complexity of production processes is significantly increased, alongside the need to enable efficient process simulation, execution, monitoring, real-time decision making and control. The main goal of our research is to define a methodological approach and a software solution in which the Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) principles and Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) are used to create a framework for the formal description and automatic execution of production processes. In that way production process models are used as central artefacts to manage the production. In this paper, we propose a DSML which can be used to create production process models that are suitable for automatic generation of executable code. The generated code is used for automatic execution of production processes within a simulation or a shop floor.||

With modelling gaining traction for analysis-heavy use cases like decision-making and regulatory compliance where domain experts play a central role, this barrier is beginning to hurt even more. We posit that Generative AI techniques can significantly lower this barrier by enabling domain experts to construct purposive models by operating at natural language level. This requires domain experts to interact with Generative AI tools using the right purpose-specific contextual prompts. We propose a model-driven approach where purposive meta models guide the interactions between domain expert and Generative AI to generate such prompts. The proposed approach helps in overcoming some of the limitations of Generative AI such as missing local context, limited context window size, attention fading etc. Industry scale models are typically large, necessitating a team of experts to work in a coordinated manner which requires sharing of outputs and persistence across sessions. Our approach brings together MDE and Generative AI in a symbiotic relationship complimenting respective strengths and overcoming limitations. We have validated this approach for development of digital twin based applications and early results are encouraging.||

Considering the robotics demonstrator for the Digital Thread concept used in Confirm, which is a small cyberphysical system based on the UR3 cobot and a web controller for it, we apply Active Automata Learning in order to obtain a Digital Twin for it. Behavior mining done in this fashion is nowadays uncommon, but it has various advantages over, e.g., models obtained with popular AI techniques in that the AAL models are accurate deterministic behavioural explanations for the system behaviour at the chosen level of abstraction, and they may be further amenable to formal verification, e.g., by model checking, in order to establish properties of interest. This extension has the effect of showcasing the Digital Twin concept, the AAL technique, the use of model checking, and the importance of working with formal models that are amenable to these technologies. We then reflect on the nature of the models and their uses and meaning, from the point of view of the comments and questions we receive in the demonstrations. We also consider the use of a feature-based approach to modelling the systems and their interactions, which is a further aspect for which the demonstrator could be used, with a special attention to the aspects of this work, like AAL and the feature based and feature interaction research, that connect directly with the collaboration with and the research of Bengt Jonsson.

While specific benefits depend on the individual applications, speech interfaces typically increase accessibility, enable 'hands-free' and 'no-screen' interaction, and often increase interaction speed and allow for more flexible usage patterns and increased multitasking, leading to higher user satisfaction. This paper presents a method to transfer these powerful benefits to the digital twin (DT) domain by automatically generating speech interfaces for DT applications. Our approach is based on Model Driven Engineering principles, where we automatically deduce command patterns from structural model information as used in, e.g., DT platform specifications. The speech interface generation is highly configurable and extendable, thus it can be applied to different DT models. The concepts behind the generator are generic as well, thus they can be ported to other applications and platforms. We validate our approach by applying it to two DT demonstration cases and provide a detailed description of the sketch interface configuration workflow.  Â© 2023 IEEE.||

Harnessing the power of twinning to cyber-physical systems offers several benefits and opportunities, that are encountered by multiple challenges. Data integration, knowledge representation, reasoning, and inferencing are crucial for providing dependable services to the twinned systems. To address these challenges, an ontology-enabled approach for modelling cyber-physical systems and their twins is proposed, which is incorporated with an intelligent agent-driven representation of the different elements of the system. Applied to a case study, this approach enables representing the knowledge of the system and its environment, capturing different aspects and integrating heterogeneous data from various sources. This allows performing reasoning and inferencing on the system to obtain valuable insights and information.||

They allow to connect various models with running systems based on bi-directional data exchange. Thus, design models can be extended with runtime views which also opens the door for many additional techniques such as identifying unexpected system changes during runtime. However, dedicated reactions to these unexpected changes, such as adapting an existing plan which has been computed in advance and may no longer be seen beneficial, are still often neglected in Digital Twins. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose so-called reactive planning that integrates Digital Twins with planning approaches to react to unforeseen changes during plan execution. In particular, we introduce an extended Digital Twin architecture which allows to integrate existing model-driven optimization frameworks. Based on this integration, we present different strategies how the replanning can be performed by utilizing the information and services available in Digital Twins. We evaluate our approach for a stack allocation case study. This evaluation yields promising results on how to effectively improve existing plans during runtime, but also allows to identify future lines of research in this area.

This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of experiments which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow.

Without this support, constraints and monitors can become stale and become less effective in long-running, rapidly changing CPS.

The former is referred to as horizontal- and the latter as vertical interoperability. This paper proposes ways to improve interoperability using multi-level and multi-view modelling methods. Multi-level modelling maximizes the reuse of information at the high-level and reduces complexity at the same time by separation of concerns. Multi-view modelling also allows to reduce complexity by selecting a subset of model elements required by a stakeholder. Currently there is no effective modelling approach that can adequately combine both methods. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling approach that integrates multi-level and multi-view modelling to support the collaborative evolution of multi-level models by different stakeholders.

To address this difficulty, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the tensor completion method by about 12.5% and 92.3%, respectively, in terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.||

Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system’s executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system’s environment based on the data recorded by the system’s digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study. By facilitating the reproduction of the system’s behavior, our method lowers the barrier to understanding the behavior of model-driven IoT systems.|Model-Driven Development, Internet of Things, Debugging, Architecture Description Languages|GPCE 2021

In particular, UI provides a set of candidate policies in complex scenarios, and supports policy makers and stakeholders in designing shared, evidence-based, and integrated solutions. UI is being applied for the first time to two Italian cities, Matera and Catania, paving the way for a deeper scientific framing of the paradigm, as well as for the technological development and testing of the core UI ecosystem in real-life situations. The paper introduces the UI key-concepts and components, illustrates the ongoing experimentations in these pilot cities related to the development of two DTs on parts of the urban areas, and presents some initial results.||

In this paper, we propose a method for the alignment of the traces of both twins. Traces are sequences of snapshots that capture the progressive states of each entity. Our approach is based on a bioinformatic algorithm that we adapt and use for the alignment of snapshots. Additionally, we include a set of measures to evaluate the quality of these alignments and reason about the level of fidelity of the digital twin system. Two case studies are used to demonstrate our proposal and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.||

Here, we focus on the development of the virtual part of the DT in a context where the physical entity already exists, offering the potential for design and engineering artifacts from the physical entity to be reused. We performed a case study on the Turtle soccer robots developed by Eindhoven University of Technology's Tech United [6] team, to explore the possibilities of reusing artifacts for the development of the corresponding virtual entity. In this paper, we present our experiences from this case study and discuss the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges we faced.|turtle soccer robot, digital twin development, artifact reuse|MODELS '22
