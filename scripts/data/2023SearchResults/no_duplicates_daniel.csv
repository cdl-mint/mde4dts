"Gkeli M.; Potsiou C.";3D crowdsourced parametric cadastral mapping: Pathways integrating BIM/IFC, crowdsourced data and LADM;2023.0;;Land Use Policy;;;"This paper is part of a doctoral dissertation (PhD) research aligned with global trends aiming to develop practical technical tools for the collection, management and visualization of three-dimensional (3D) property rights in urban areas. Recently, the Building Information Models (BIMs) claim a prominent position in the field of 3D cadastres and the digital twins of the cities. In addition to all other building information, the BIM can also provide data about the exact boundaries of all kind of legal spaces (e.g., property ownership rights as well as land use restrictions), under the support of Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs). However, the utilization of BIMs for 3D cadastral surveys is still accompanied with two main drawbacks. The first refers to BIMs limited availability, as till now they mainly encounter in new large constructions. The second refers to the complexity in defining the exact geometric location of the legal boundaries regarding the exterior/interior partitions of the construction and of the common spaces. The latter parameter is formed on the basis of the current legal legislation in each country. Through in-depth investigation of the current legal framework of each country it may be possible to visualize the various 3D legal spaces within complex constructions and thus to facilitate the integration of existing BIMs in the development of 3D cadasters that will enable a better understanding and communication of all involved parties in the operation of cross-boundary real estate markets. In parallel, crowdsourcing has already been proved to be a powerful data collection method for the initial participatory implementation of fast, reliable and affordable 3D cadastral surveys, utilizing all capabilities provided by the latest low-cost devices, mobile services (m-services), open-source software (OSS) and the international standard of Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152). If no precise 3D building models are already available, the currently available 2D architectural plans combined with the additional geometric and descriptive cadastral information may be utilized for a participatory crowdsourced cadastral survey of the 3D property units. In this paper a two-route crowdsourced approach is described. This approach suggests both the use of existing BIMs  those available  to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of those constructions, as well as the use of 2D georeferenced basemaps (e.g., orthophotos for the compilation of 2D crowdsourced cadastral surveys, and all existing architectural floor plans of the constructions) to proceed with 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys of all other constructions. A database schema describing the linkage between LADM standard, BIM/IFC and 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive cadastral information is developed and presented. A hybrid mobile application enabling the manipulation of BIM/IFC descriptive data  if existing; the collection of 3D crowdsourced geometric and descriptive information by property owners/users/non-professionals; the registration of the cadastral data and their relationships within a LADM-based cadastral geodatabase; the automated generation of 3D property unit models as block models (LoD1), using Model-driven approach; and the objects visualization in real-time, are developed. An investigation regarding the legally correct representation of the location of property unit boundaries, focusing mainly in the Greek territory is conducted. A practical experiment for each one of the cases of the two-route crowdsourced approach is implemented, for two multi-storey buildings in the city of Athens, Greece. The potentials of the proposed crowdsourced solution as well as the achieved geometric accuracy  in the absence of BIM  are discussed and assessed. The results show that integrating BIM data with cadastral information derived from crowdsourcing, may significantly contribute to the implementation of 3D Cadastres, providing also a better visual understanding of 3D property rights. Nonetheless, even in the absence of a BIM the achieved accuracy seems to satisfy the cadastral specifications of the Greek cadaster enhancing the potential of exploiting crowdsourced data in the initial phases of the cadastral formal procedures. © 2023";;

They help in saving time and physical resources when developing and evolving systems, whether natural or engineered. However, constructing and maintaining digital twins is a challenging engineering task - and, to date, there is a lack of understanding of the engineering techniques and methodologies required. To address these challenges, we created EDT.Community, a programme of seminars on the engineering of digital twins hosting digital twins experts from academia and industry. In this paper, we report on the main topics of discussion from the first year of the programme. We contribute by providing (1) a common understanding of open challenges in research and practice of the engineering of digital twins, and (2) an entry point to researchers who aim to close gaps in the current state of the art.;;
"Liu, Q; Liu, B; Wang, G; Zhang, C";A Comparative Study on Digital Twin Models;;;ADVANCES IN MATERIALS, MACHINERY, ELECTRONICS III;;;As the main concept, the Digital Twin (DT) shows its potential not only in industry 4.0 but also in other areas. One of the keys that decide the future of DT been known as its model technology. Through models can integrate features, behaviors, and properties of DT artifacts with efficiency, reusability, and interoperability, in order to build a complete mapping between the physical world and digital world, after that realize the ideal DT. This paper aims at comparing and analyzing the DT models in the scientific literature, retracing them from the initial one to the models in most recent researches. Thus, this study also emphasizes several principles of the DT model technology that is related to future work.;;

Our genomes, disease histories, behavior, and lifestyles are all different; therefore it is not too surprising that people often respond differently when administered the same drugs. Cancer, in particular, is a complex and heterogeneous disease, originating in patients with different genomes, in cells with the different epigenomes, formed and evolving on the basis of random processes, with the response to therapy not only depending on the individual cancer cell but also on many features of the patient. Selection of an optimal therapy will therefore require a deep molecular analysis comprising both the patient and their tumor (e.g., comprehensive molecular tumor analysis [CMTA]), and much better personalized prediction of response to possible therapies. Currently, we are at an inflection point in which advances in technology, decreases in the costs of sequencing and other molecular analyses, and increases in computing advances are converging, forming the foundation to build a data-driven approach to personalized oncology. In this article we discuss the deep molecular characterization of individual tumors and patients as the basis of not only current precision oncology but also of computational models ('digital twins'), the foundation for a truly personalized therapy selection of the future.";;
"Song Y.; Xia M.; Chen Q.; Chen F.";A data-model fusion dispatch strategy for the building energy flexibility based on the digital twin;2023.0;;Applied Energy;;;With the growing percentage of the intermittent renewable power generation, the energy system is under increasing pressure in balancing the supply and the demand. As a major part of urban energy consumptions, buildings can provide considerable regulation flexibility for the energy system by actively managing their energy demands. For the building energy flexibility (BEF) provided by thermostatically controlled loads (TCL), its dispatch performance is vulnerable to the building thermal parameter errors, and in some cases, occupants need to provide the critical information related to the indoor temperature state and the occupancy state to the energy management system outside buildings, which decreases the availability of the BEF and raises privacy concerns. For these issues in the BEF utilization, this paper proposes a data-model fusion dispatch strategy based on the digital twin (DT). The proposed strategy is capable of parameter fault tolerance and privacy protection by combining the model-free advantage of the data-driven method with the analytical optimization advantage of the model-driven method. Firstly, a DT-based BEF dispatch framework is proposed. Secondly, the building DT is established by combining the building thermal dynamics (BTD) data-driven model and the TCL operation mechanism model. And the building response deduction is carried out based on the DT. Finally, under the rolling optimization framework, the data-model fusion dispatch strategy is devised by uniting the DT deduction and the optimization constructed by the BTD mechanism model, in which the multi-dimensional modeling of the BTD is carried out from the state dimension and the energy dimension. The simulation results show that the optimization result can reach 98.4% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% parameter random error, and 98.3% of the ideal result under the scenario with 15% random state noise injection. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;;
"Poursoltan M.; Traore M.K.; Pinède N.; Vallespir B.";A Digital Twin Model-Driven Architecture for Cyber-Physical and Human Systems;2023.0;;Proceedings of the I-ESA Conferences;;;The cyber-physical and human system (CPHS) is widely recognized as a key infrastructure to support the future developments in healthcare, industrial manufacturing as well as in many other areas. In consequence, there is an increasing interest in tools, techniques, and technologies to advance the understanding and provide unchallenging improvement of CPHS. Digital Twin is a growing research topic that can equip the CPHS with high-fidelity mirroring, monitoring, controlling, and active functional improvement. The central question in this study asks in what way Digital Twin should be designed and developed for a CPHS. An architecture was required to answer this question and build upon model to define guidelines and requirements for valid Digital Twin. Thus, this study provides much new knowledge about the emerging role of Digital Twin in CPHS by using a model-driven architecture (MDA) approach with the perspective of SD logic. In addition, in the presence of human roles, the given MDA is beneficial for providing abstractions of Digital Twin from different viewpoints, communication with non-technical experts, and decision support, system design, and improvement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;;
"Picone M.; Mamei M.; Zambonelli F.";A Flexible and Modular Architecture for Edge Digital Twin: Implementation and Evaluation;2023.0;;ACM Transactions on Internet of Things;;;IoT systems based on Digital Twins (DTs) - virtual copies of physical objects and systems - can be very effective to enable data-driven services and promote better control and decisions, in particular by exploiting distributed approaches where cloud and edge computing cooperate effectively. In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.;;
"Parri J.; Patara F.; Sampietro S.; Vicario E.";A framework for Model-Driven Engineering of resilient software-controlled systems;2021.0;;Computing;;;Emergent paradigms of Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things expect cyber-physical systems to reliably provide services overcoming disruptions in operative conditions and adapting to changes in architectural and functional requirements. In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, a reflective architecture developed around digital twins enables representation and control of system Configuration Items properly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones. © 2020, The Author(s).;;
"Huangfu, YF; Dong, XJ; Cao, YX; Li, ZW; Peng, ZK; Sun, YT";A life-cycle dynamic wear degradation model of planetary gear systems;;;WEAR;;;An accurate prediction model for surface wear in planetary gear systems is essential to decipher wear fault mechanisms and facilitate model-driven failure prognosis. A high-fidelity dynamic wear model relies on the appropriate characterization and updating strategy of the tooth macro-geometry, contact parameters and dynamic load. A geometrically adaptive-loaded tooth contact analysis (GA-LTCA) method is proposed to bridge wear morphology and dynamic behaviours. The finite element method and run-to-failure test are adopted to verify the GA-LTCA method and wear prediction model, respectively. Based on the proposed wear model, the life-cycle wear characteristics and the updating strategy of wear geometry are investigated. Owing to the consideration of the micro-cycle of the contact stress and geometrical updating, the predicted wear profile exhibits a desirable agreement with experimental results. The tooth profile deviation vector should be updated more frequently than the finite element model of worn gears. Only the finite element grid of the sun-planet gear pair should be updated because the wear of the sun-planet is much more serious than that of the ring-planet. Numerical results indicate the potential of the proposed high-fidelity model for digital twin-based wear prediction and life cycle failure prognosis.;;

People use simulation technologies to complete the process of physical equipment in virtual space. As the manager of production process data, MES system is an important basis of digital twin in industrial production. Current MES systems are mostly developed for specific domains, often for large enterprises, with high coupling and poor scalability, which are difficult to be applied to smaller production enterprises with low informationization degree. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model-driven MES simulation framework that uses probabilistic finite automata to form a fast modeling for factory as well as to generate production data, and achieves a highly flexible production process simulation through config files; the framework could also be used to build a real MES system for small and medium-sized production enterprises. © 2022 IEEE.";;

While sophisticated modeling languages like SysML describe systems and their components, data often ends up in purpose-built relational and time series databases. To generate value, information must be retrieved and integrated from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose an innovative method for leveraging SysML engineering models and database queries by combining them in a collaborative low-code web environment. First, we make heterogeneous databases available via GraphQL, a state-of-the-art approach for building Web APIs. Then, our web application enables domain experts to exploit containment relations in SysML models to connect diverse data sources. The outcome is an integrated GraphQL API that matches the engineering model structures by resembling views across multiple database sources. The discussed approach incorporates the benefits of data-oriented development and low-code platforms beyond the business automation domain.;;

The DT provides a virtual representation of products along their lifecycle that enables the prediction and optimization of the behavior of a production system and its components. A methodology design using model-driven engineering (MDE) is proposed that strives toward being both flexible and generic. This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.";;
"Bocciarelli, P; D'Ambrogio, A; Panetti, T";A Model Based Framework for IoT-Aware Business Process Management;2023.0;;FUTURE INTERNET;;10.3390/fi15020050;IoT-aware Business Processes (BPs) that exchange data with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, briefly referred to as IoT-aware BPs, are gaining momentum in the BPM field. Introducing IoT technologies from the early stages of the BP development process requires dealing with the complexity and heterogeneity of such technologies at design and analysis time. This paper analyzes widely used IoT frameworks and ontologies to introduce a BPMN extension that improves the expressiveness of relevant BP modeling notations and allows an appropriate representation of IoT devices from both an architectural and a behavioral perspective. In the BP management field, the use of simulation-based approaches is recognized as an effective technology for analyzing BPs. Simulation models need to be parameterized according to relevant properties of the process under study. Unfortunately, such parameters may change during the process operational life, thus making the simulation model invalid with respect to the actual process behavior. To ease the analysis of IoT-aware BPs, this paper introduces a model-driven method for the automated development of digital twins of actual business processes. The proposed method also exploits data retrieved by IoT sensors to automatically reconfigure the simulation model, to make the digital twin continuously coherent and compliant with its actual counterpart.;;

Engineering digital twin solutions is a knowledge and effort intensive activity. In-depth knowledge of manufacturing plant, process operations, underlying physics, data, and technical problems is essential in the design of digital twin application for a given business objective. Industry domain experts, data scientists and solution developers must collaborate to build it with the required features and functionalities. Currently, it is not an easily scalable process. For each industry vertical and even for the same plant type, the development process has to be repeated manually. To address this, we present a model-driven knowledge-based approach where knowledge can be captured in a machine processible form and reasoned with, to systematically guide the solution development process. Knowledge is modelled at three levels of abstraction, namely, meta, plant type and plant instance. We describe how this helps in generalizing the knowledge, in driving the knowledge acquisition process, and in contextualizing knowledge to specific problem instances. We then outline how the captured knowledge can be exploited to guide various digital twin engineering tasks such as problem definition, model building (physics or data-driven), data preparation, algorithm selection, etc. In particular, we discuss how the approach helps in arriving at a detailed digital twin specification starting from a high-level business problem statement. We present a case study demonstrating the approach on a real-life industrial problem.  Â© 2023 IEEE.;;
"Shokooh S.; Nordvik G.";A Model-Driven Approach for Situational Intelligence & Operational Awareness;2019.0;;Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference Europe Conference Proceedings, PCIC EUROPE;;;In order to design, operate, and maintain an oil and gas facility, one must first understand its behavior. A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely.Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a 'digital twin' of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system.A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation.This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems.

While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.;;

Digital twin is expected to accurately estimate the real-time hydraulic parameters of blind spots of the pumping station system even under some adverse conditions including the interference of observation noise and model parameters drift. To solve these challenges, a digital twin framework integrating the model-driven method, control theory and data-driven method is presented. In this framework, an unsteady flow state estimation method combining frequency domain analysis and generalized predictive control theory is developed for the first time, which is superior to traditional time-domain numerical discrete methods in terms of computational efficiency and anti-noise interference. In the model parameter calibration process, the novelty concerns modeling of the optimization problem considering the dynamic operation control of the station and unsteady flow of pipelines. And this process is accomplished through the comprehensive application of the model-free adaptive control algorithm, the transient flow model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. This work is applied to a pumping station in a product pipeline to verify its effectiveness in estimating the transient flow state of data blind spots and map the dynamic operation behavior under the interference of colored noise and parameter drift.

"Xu, CY; Li, WY; Zhao, Y";A Novel Fused NARX-Driven Digital Twin Model for Aeroengine Gas Path Parameter Prediction;;;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS;;;In this article, we propose a digital twin model (DTM) based on the nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous (NARX) inputs model network to predict engine gas path parameters accurately. The DTM is combined by a model-driven model (MDM) and a data-driven model (DDM). To allocate the function of MDM and DDM, a pretreating fusion method is proposed for the first time, which is divided into three parts. First, all parameters are predicted by the MDM. Second, for the parameters with bad predictive effects, the DDM is employed to optimize them. Third, the parameters with good predictive effects and those optimized by DDM are fused to generate the DTM. The DDM is built by a two-stage NARX. Particularly, a NARX with a gate recurrent unit attention mapping function is used to improve the accuracy of the predicted parameters. The experimental results show that the maximum prediction error of the DTM is less than 5%. This implies that the fused DTM guarantees the prediction accuracy of each gas path parameter in the case of performance degradation.;;
"Christofi, N; Pucel, X";A Novel Methodology to Construct Digital Twin Models for Spacecraft Operations Using Fault and Behaviour Trees;;;ACM/IEEE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS, MODELS 2022 COMPANION;;;Successful satellite data reception requires the nominal operation of the ground stations in charge of their health monitoring as much as the spacecrafts themselves. Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.;;
"Lehner, D; Sint, S; Eisenberg, M; Wimmer, M";A pattern catalog for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavior;;;AT-AUTOMATISIERUNGSTECHNIK;;;Digital Twins are emerging as a solution to build and extend existing software systems to make better use of data produced by physical systems. For supporting the development of Digital Twins, several software vendors are offering dedicated tool support, often referred to as Digital Twin platforms. The modeling capabilities of these platforms are mostly concerned with structural viewpoints, i.e., providing an overview of available components including their current and historical sensor values. However, behavioral viewpoints did not yet receive much attention on these platforms. As behavioral models are often used during the design processes, e.g., for simulation and synthesis, it would be beneficial for having them included in Digital Twin platforms, e.g., for reasoning on the set of possible next actions or for checking the execution history to perform runtime validation. In this paper, we present a catalog of modeling patterns for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavioral models and their corresponding runtime information without requiring any extension of the code bases of Digital Twin platforms. We demonstrate the presented modeling patterns by applying them to the Digital Twin platform offered by Microsoft, in an additive manufacturing use case of a 3D printer in a production line.;;

However, the definition of Digital Twin (DT) is still abstract and context-dependent. In this paper, we present a metamodel that supports concrete and operational descriptions of digital twin deployment. This metamodel encompasses the different aspects of deployment, including the definition of hardware and software components that compose the layered cyber-physical architectures of the digital twin, along with the installation and instantiation tasks that compose deployment processes. Multiple configurations can also be defined to support the deployment of a digital twin in different execution contexts. The relevance of this metamodel was evaluated by two case studies. The first consists in deploying the digital twin of a cobot in a simulation environment. The second applies the approach in a home automation environment. In both cases, our metamodel provides complete and precise descriptions of the deployment process and thus constitutes a viable first step towards a model-driven approach for digital twin deployment.  © 2022 IEEE.;;

To solve the above problems, an updating method for knowledge in the virtual model driven by data is studied. Firstly, the behavior model in the virtual model can be divided into basic functional models such as forward kinematics, trajectory planning, and material generation, and the knowledge components to support functional model computation are constructed. Secondly, the evaluation indexes for the quality, maintainability, and reliability of the knowledge components are established, and appropriate knowledge component combinations can be selected from the knowledge component base. Then, based on the measurements, it is used to the triggering judgment, and a knowledge component combination with the smallest difference between the simulation output of the virtual model and the real data of physical entities is selected from multiple combinations to realize the iterative update of the model. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by examples.;;

Our genomes, disease histories, behavior, and lifestyles are all different. It is not too surprising, therefore, that we often respond differently to the drugs we receive. Cancer, in particular, is a complex and heterogeneous disease, originating in patients with different genomes, in cells with different epigenomes, formed and evolving on the basis of random processes, with the response to therapy not only depending on the individual cancer cell but also on many features of the patient. Selection of an optimal therapy will therefore require a deep molecular analysis comprising both the patient and their tumor (e.g., comprehensive molecular tumor analysis [CMTA]), and much better personalized prediction of response to possible therapies. Currently, we are at an inflection point in which advances in technology, decreases in the costs of sequencing and other molecular analyses, and increases in computing power are converging, forming the foundation to build a data-driven approach to personalized oncology. Here, we discuss the deep molecular characterization of individual tumors and patients as the basis of not only current precision oncology but also of computational models (digital twins), forming the foundation of a truly personalized therapy selection of the future. © 2019, The Author(s).;;

The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations.

Model-driven engineering (MDE) methods have been proven to be effective in increasing the productivity of CPS design. However, there is still a lack of MDE approaches that enable design space exploration as well as the code generation for the design of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based CPSs. To mitigate the situation, this article presents a unified modeling language named AIoTML for AIoT-based CPSs, which enables the construction of AI-based components across different modeling levels for the purposes of intelligent sensing and control. By extending the constructs of state-of-the-art domain-specific language (DSL) ThingML, AIoTML can seamlessly unify the modeling of both autonomous executions of AIoT devices and their surrounding physical environment, which facilitates both platform-independent simulation and control optimization for platform-specific CPSs. The compiler developed for AIoTML provides a family of code generators to support the construction of digital twins on various heterogeneous target AIoT platforms.

Digital Twins (DTs) provide comprehensive views on such systems, the data they generate during runtime, as well as their usage and evolution over time. Setting up the required infrastructure to run a Digital Twin is still an ambitious task that involves significant upfront efforts from domain experts, although existing knowledge about the systems, such as engineering models, may be already available for reuse. To address this issue, we present AML4DT, a model-driven framework supporting the development and maintenance of Digital Twin infrastructures by employing AutomationML (AML) models. We automatically establish a connection between systems and their DTs based on dedicated DT models. These DT models are automatically derived from existing AutomationML models, which are produced in the engineering phases of a system. Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases.

Driven by data and simulators, the digital twin can create the virtual twins of physical objects to perform monitoring, simulation, prediction, optimization, and so on. Hence, the application of digital twin can increase efficiency and security of systems by providing reliable model and decision supports. In this paper, we propose a state-aware model learning method to simulate and analyze the lightweight protocol implementations in edge/cloud environments. We introduce the data flow of program execution and network interaction inputs/outputs (I/O) into the extended finite state machine (EFSM) to expand the modeling scope and insight. We aim to calibrate the states and construct an accurate state-machine model using a digital twin based layered approach to reasonably reflect the correlation of a device's external behavior and internal data. This, in turn, improves our ability to verify the logic and evaluate the security for protocol implementations. This method firstly involves instrumenting the target device to monitor variable activity during its execution. We then employ learning algorithms to produce multiple rounds of message queries. Both the I/O data corresponding to these query sequences and the state calibration information derived from filtered memory variables are obtained through the mapper and execution monitor, respectively. These two aspects of information are combined to dynamically and incrementally construct the protocol's state machine. We apply this method to develop SALearn and evaluate the effectiveness of SALearn on two lightweight protocol implementations. Our experimental results indicate that SALearn outperforms existing protocol model learning tools, achieving higher learning efficiency and uncovering more interesting states and security issues. In total, we identified two violation scenarios of rekey logic. These situations also reflect the differences in details between different implementations.;;

Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks.

Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-to-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology. In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins.

Just as with textual languages, the concrete syntax is the representation of the language elements intended for humans and thus has a decisive influence on the comprehensibility and usability of the language.The concrete syntax of GLML is often defined less precisely or in less detail when designing metamodels. While metamodels can be designed independently or even without concrete syntax, the latter is required for the actual usage of a graphical language. The layout and the interaction support for editing the language elements are commonly delegated to tool development. However, the development of modeling tools focuses on functionality such as model transformation and model execution, disregarding usability and handling. Low user acceptance then leads to niche applications and a limited number of users. The main reason for the lack of support for laying out and editing the language elements are complex integration challenges mainly concerning the development or adaptation of suitable layout procedures for GLML.Some frameworks offer a remedy by providing layout procedures for GLML. However, GLML differ from each other concerning their concrete syntax. Even minor differences in the concrete syntax of two languages can make the desirransferable or only transferable through complex adaptations. Formal methods for matching the concrete syntax of a GLML with existing layout procedures as early as during the development of the language are missing.In this paper, we present a classification scheme for layout procedures for GLML. The classification scheme is based on a classification scheme we developed for the concrete syntax of GLML, and it contains significant features. We define a mapping procedure between the two classifiers. As a result, the mapping decides whether a layout procedure can be used for a GLML. Both the classification scheme and the process of mapping are demonstrated in a real-world example of a technical graphical domain-specific modeling language.The presented approach supports the design of GLML and the tool development for GLML. It can be an important step towards automated tool development.;layout-algorithm reuse, graph-like modeling languages, designing and implementing modeling languages, concrete syntax of modeling languages;MODELS '22

To overcome this challenge, over the past years, various Industry 4.0 automation and robotics providers have presented solutions based on visual block programming languages, which follow an emerging low-code approach to reduce the entry barriers of digital technologies. However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap! to create SDL4Snap!, an opensource and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes. Overall, the resulting tool has the potential to reduce the entry barrier to Digital Twins in small and medium enterprises, which are part of the late majority and laggard groups regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0.;;

Unfortunately, the two most commonly used modeling approaches, physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) struggle to satisfy all these requirements. In the current work, we demonstrate how a hybrid approach combining the best of PBM and DDM can result in models that can outperform both of them. We do so by combining partial differential equations based on first principles describing partially known physics with a black box DDM, in this case, a deep neural network model compensating for the unknown physics. The novelty of the work is in the theoretical contribution of presenting a sound mathematical argument for why the approach should work. The argument is backed by an array of experiments involving a two-dimensional heat diffusion problem with unknown source terms. The hybrid approach demonstrates the method's superior performance in accuracy and generalizability. Additionally, it is shown how the DDM part can be interpreted within the hybrid framework to make the overall approach reliable. The approach, as we see, will be a door opener for underutilized DDMs in high stake applications. © 2022 The Author(s);;

Therefore, universities must integrate the development of Digital Twins into their educational program to enable future engineers to overcome the challenges concomitant with Digital Twins. While a theoretical basis for Digital Twins is crucial e.g., hardware-software integration, Internet of Things (IoT) or simulation models, a practical combination of these heterogeneous components is also necessary to introduce the Digital Twin as a whole concept. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) an approach was introduced to grasp complexity by using system models e.g., through SysML diagrams.

"Hu, D; Wang, HC; Yang, CL; Wang, BB; Yang, QR; Wang, YY";Construction and verification of dual-fuel engine combustion model;;;JOURNAL OF THE ENERGY INSTITUTE;;;In order to achieve real-time mapping and online optimization of the combustion process of a dual-fuel engine that is in prolonged operation, this paper is the first to combine the Wiebe function with a deep learning neural network to propose a zero-dimensional (0-D) combustion prediction model for a biodiesel-diesel dual-fuel engine. First, the parameters of the double Wiebe functions are calculated by the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA), and the operating parameters and Wiebe parameters are used as input and output parameters of neural networks, respectively, to construct parameter identification models. Then, the combustion process is simplified and reconstructed by combining the Wiebe function with the deep learning neural network, and a 0-D prediction model based on the hybrid model-driven and data-driven method is established, which can further obtain combustion results such as cylinder pressure curve and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). The results show that the coefficient of determination (R-2) value of the dual-fuel engine 0-D prediction model based on the double Wiebe function combined with POA-CNN-Bi-LSTM is 0.9827, and the model has good prediction accuracy and generalization. The development of the combustion model provides reliable numerical model support for the online evaluation and optimization of dual-fuel engine performance.;;

This study presents a zero-dimensional (0-D) prediction model that integrates the advantages of model-driven and data-driven approaches. Initially, the snake optimization algorithm (SO) is employed to address the challenges related to low parameter fitting accuracy and multiple solutions in calculating Wiebe parameters. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (CNN-Bi-LSTM) is devised to establish a nonlinear correlation between operating parameters and Wiebe parameters. The structural parameters of CNN-Bi-LSTM are then optimized using the SO algorithm (SO-CNN-Bi-LSTM). Ultimately, a 0-D prediction combustion model is formulated by amalgamating the Wiebe function with the neural network, enabling real-time prediction of combustion results and generalization analysis of prediction performance under non-calibrated conditions. The findings demonstrate that the combustion model exhibits heightened accuracy, thereby establishing a robust technical foundation for the development of a digital twin in the engine combustion process.;;

Current systems however do a poor job of coordinating the underlying rules and explaining the system's behavior to developers. This negatively impacts a system's performance due to behaving in unintended and hard-to-comprehend ways. In this vision paper, we introduce an approach that intends to alleviate these problems, for the use-case of high-performance cloud clusters, through the use of a cyber-cyber digital twin based on the Palladio ecosystem. The conceived digital twin allows for several functions that are unexplored in literature so far: the combination of design time analysis with explainability, use of state-space prediction bounded by likelihood, and explanation of non-applicability. This is achieved through a digital twin performing three main activities: 1) The predicting activity predicts system performance along several potential paths. 2) The planning activity analyzes reconfiguration rules and predicted system behavior to produce reconfiguration plans that try to optimally utilize available resources and achieve all SLOs without unintended interactions between the execution of rules. 3) The explaining activity processes all artifacts produced during system simulation time or runtime to provide comprehensive visualizations to developers. We explain how each activity is performed and what models it processes and produces based on a running example.;;

Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime. We evaluate our CPSAML language and code generation framework on an Indoor Transport System case study with Roomba vacuum cleaner robots. Â© 2022 Owner/Author.;;

Together with fast-paced trends, it drives complexity and uncertainty in many domains. Yet, its potentials are manifold and, in most cases, outweigh the disadvantages. Beneath terms such as ""big data"", ""digital twin"", the term ""data-driven engineering"" has evolved over the last years. However, neither in literature nor in industry, there is a unified definition or understanding of the term. The presented research is based on a literature review as well as an industrial case study. Several databases were screened systematically for the literature review and forward and backward searches were used additionally. The case study was conducted in a collaboration with a company in the climate system sector. First, a literature-based distinction between the terms model-based, model-driven, data-based, and data-driven as well as definitions of data-driven engineering were investigated. Representatives of the company then evaluated these findings in a workshop and together with the industry partner a consistent definition was developed. The authors define data-driven engineering as a framework for product development in which the goal-oriented collection and use of sufficiently connected product lifecycle data guides and drives decisions and applications in the product development process. Further, promising use cases for the industry partner regarding data-driven engineering were formulated. The use cases were initially evaluated and prioritized regarding their cost-benefit ratio. Symbioses with other strategies of the company such as Digital Twins, model-based engineering, and solution space engineering are outlined. For academia, the presented findings provide a consistent definition that can be used as a promising direction for future research. Especially a procedure model for the systematic conception and implementation of data-driven engineering would be beneficial.

"Gutierrez-Franco, E; Mejia-Argueta, C; Rabelo, L";Data-Driven Methodology to Support Long-Lasting Logistics and Decision Making for Urban Last-Mile Operations;;;SUSTAINABILITY;;;Last-mile operations in forward and reverse logistics are responsible for a large part of the costs, emissions, and times in supply chains. These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.;;

Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.  © 2021 IEEE.;;

The objective of HAM is to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and self-evolving models. CoSTA achieves this objective by augmenting the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term generated using a deep neural network. In a series of numerical experiments on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is found to outperform comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy  often reducing predictive errors by several orders of magnitude  while also generalizing better than pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM. Its theoretical foundation also ensures that CoSTA can be used to model any system governed by (deterministic) partial differential equations. Moreover, CoSTA facilitates interpretation of the DNN-generated source term within the context of PBM, which results in improved explainability of the DNN. These factors make CoSTA a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM. © 2021 The Author(s);;

Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving.

Here, an electrochemical-thermal coupled model is developed as a digital twin model for rational design of ultrahigh-power LiFePO4/graphite LIBs. The model can accurately predict the batteries performance and help to predetermine the optimal parameters to achieve an ultrahigh power capability. After model-guided optimization, the battery shows a high energy density of 92.38 Wh kg?1 at an ultrafast discharging current of 50 C and can withstand 150 C pulse discharging tests. Notably, the digital twin model can reveal experimentally inaccessible time- and space-resolved information and identify the rate-determining steps inside the battery.

First, a three-dimensional geometric model of the power transformer is built based on ANSYS Maxwell platform, including the iron core, windings, etc. Then, a digital model of the characteristic parameterization of the transformer in the digital space is established. The electromagnetic field and the temperature field based on ANSYS Workbench platform are coupled. Also, The temperature distribution of the air-immersed transformer core-winding module under six typical different working conditions is studied, and the hot spot location and temperature distribution rule under different working conditions are obtained. The simulation results of magnetic flux density, voltage and current under different operating conditions, losses and theoretical values show that the proposed DT model can effectively reflect the physical mechanism of the transformer. In addition, the simulated results show that the iron core temperature does not rise with the increase of the load rate and the winding temperature rises with the increase of the load rate.

To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%.

The Digital Twin (DT) aspect indicates a connection between the physical object and the corresponding virtual twin established by generating real-time data using sensors. The DT represents physical object operation throughout its life cycle, making it an essential tool for improving that object's reliability. In this paper, an application of the DT service unit for AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection is presented. According to real-time measurements, Linux Robot Operation System (ROS) simulates AC electrical machine-specific behavior in case of unbalanced stator currents and notify about possible fault appearance and propagation.

In the general framework presented in this work, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection. We specifically investigate the application of the proposed framework to a simple case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. The Bayesian model trained at the DT has the key advantage of capturing epistemic uncertainty regarding the communication system, e.g., regarding current traffic conditions, which arise from limited PT-to-DT data transfer. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.  Â© 2023 IEEE.;;

Currently, this process is highly reliant upon manual inputs, needing 10 times more labour hours than scanning the physical asset. The resulting modelling cost counteracts the expected benefits of the digital twin. We tackle this challenge using a novel model-driven method that exploits the highly regulated and standardised nature of railways. It starts by restricting the search for OLE elements relative to point clusters of the railway masts. The resulting point clusters of the OLE elements are then converged with various parametric models of different catenary configurations to verify the presence of OLE elements and to find the best possible fit. The method outputs a geometry-only digital twin of the OLE system in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The method was tested on an 18 km railway point cloud and achieves overall detection rates of 93.2% F1 score for OLE cables and 98.1% F1 score for other OLE elements. The accuracy of the generated model is evaluated using distance-based metrics between the ground truth model and the automated model. The average modelling distance is 3.82 cm Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for all 18 km data.

Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-Target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-The-Art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-Target tracking scenes.

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.  Â© 2023 IEEE.;;

CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems. Â© 2023, The Author(s).;;

Because it builds a more flexible and communicative production system through models that spans life cycle, hierarchy and architecture. The standard proposed under the concept of Industry 4.0, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), provides a syntactic interoperability interface for all assets involved in smart factories. However, there is still a need to fill the gap regarding semantic interoperability, in order to allow efficient interactions between Industry 4.0 components. Ontologies are a good candidate because they provide formal semantics expressed using a knowledge representation language, and in addition, there are many associated mature tools for reasoning and inference. Therefore, we propose a modeling approach that provides semantic interoperability for AAS-based digital twins using ontologies.;;
"Cimino C.; Leva A.; Ferretti G.";Ensuring consistency in scalable-detail models for DT-based control;2021.0;;IFAC-PapersOnLine;;;Digital Twins (DTs for short) are a powerful aid for creating, assessing and maintaining control strategies. This use of DTs however requires that the physical entities to control be described at different levels of detail. For example, simple I/O models are used to compute parameters of modulating controllers, more time-accurate ones may be required to set up and assess logic controls, high-accuracy, possibly nonlinear ones may serve for overall strategy verification, and for software-in-the-loop testing, also the host computing/network architecture needs representing. In such a complex scenario, guaranteeing that all the descriptions of all elements are consistent with one another is a relevant problem. We discuss this matter and propose a solution, in the form of a modelling paradigm where - as a novel contributions - relationships (in a sense analogous to what the term means in database theory) can be instated and enforced. This allows to create and maintain knowledge based made of interrelate data and models, embracing all the major DT interpretations proposed so far in the literature, or said more explicitly, combining data-driven and model-driven DTs in a single framework. We also provide an illustrative example. © 2021 The Authors. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0);;

In practice, this requires analyzing, preparing for adaptation, and adapting brownfield manufacturing systems. The digital twin, a digital representation of a manufacturing system, is a key enabler for efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability. Unfortunately, the analysis and preparation of brownfield systems for adaptation, as well as the creation of digital twins, are challenging and time-consuming tasks. This paper presents an approach to automatically create digital models of systems based on 3D CAD models. To this end, the CAD data, stored as a STEP file, is analyzed to extract relevant information for a subsequent graph analysis, which is used to identify components, their dependencies, and the resulting functional modules. Finally, the gained knowledge is transformed into feature models that can be used as a digital model for configuration selection to support automatic reconfiguration planning of brownfield manufacturing systems. The developed approach is evaluated based on an industrial use case of a soft gripper system.;;

To this effect, a digital twin is to be developed and configured and potentially also operated by domain experts, who rarely have a professional software engineering background and for whom easy access and support, e.g., in form of low-code platforms are missing. In this paper, we report on an integrated method for the model-driven engineering of low-code development platforms for digital twins that enables domain experts to create and operate digital twins for cyberphysical systems using the most appropriate modeling languages. The foundation of this method is (1) a code generation infrastructure for information systems combined with (2) an extensible base architecture for self-adaptive digital twins and (3) reusable language components for their configuration. Using this method, software engineers first configure the information system with the required modeling languages to generate the low-code development platform for digital twins before domain experts leverage the generated platform to create digital twins. This two-step method facilitates creating tailored low-code development platforms as well as creating and operating customized digital twins for a variety of applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;;

Monitors are established by identifying runtime properties of interest, creating probes to instrument the system, and defining constraints to be checked at runtime. For many systems, implementing and setting up a monitoring platform can be tedious and time-consuming, as generic monitoring platforms do not adequately cover domain-specific monitoring requirements. This situation is exacerbated when the System under Monitoring (SuM) evolves, requiring changes in the monitoring platform. Most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for dealing with system evolution. In this paper, we present GRuM (Generating CPS Runtime Monitors), a framework that combines model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring, to automatically generate a customized monitoring platform for a given SuM. Relevant properties are captured in a Domain Model Fragment, and changes to the SuM can be easily accommodated by automatically regenerating the platform code. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance we evaluated GRuM against two different systems using TurtleBot robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Results show that GRuM facilitates the creation and evolution of a runtime monitoring platform with little effort and that the platform can handle a substantial amount of events and data.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks.

Muñoz, P;How Alike are my Physical and Digital Twins?;;;ACM/IEEE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS, MODELS 2022 COMPANION;;;A digital twin is a virtual replica of a system defined at a certain level of fidelity, and synchronized at a specific frequency. Digital twins are often used to replicate physical systems whose simulations are usually computationally costly. One of the solutions proposed in the literature to this problem is to define a hierarchy of multi-fidelity digital twins, where we use one twin or another depending on the specific purpose. However, one of the challenges of this proposal is the need to determine whether these twins are equivalent to each other and the physical system according to their purpose. In this work, we explore different methods to measure this equivalence by analyzing the state and behavior of the twins using high-level software models.;;

"Barosan I.; Van Der Heijden J.";Integration of SysML models in a 3D environment for Virtual Testing and Validation;2022.0;;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;;;Model-Driven Systems Engineering has been presented as a promising approach for developing complex systems. To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system's development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.  © 2022 Owner/Author.;;

This is in contrast to the traditional approach, where recipes are programmed into the production system ahead-of-time. However, automated planning relies on specific languages and tools that are hard to master by nonexperts, which is a factor that strongly limited the utilization of plan-driven approaches for industrial automation in practice. Thus, we propose to generate planning tasks automatically with model-driven engineering techniques. We are utilizing the industrial standard IEC 62264 for the description of the production system, and the academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for planning. PDDL is handled completely transparent to the user, that is the user is shielded from its complexity by employing the IEC 62264 model as the sole frontend.;;

However, adopting networking models requires significant effort and cooperation from various stakeholders.The focus of this paper is to explore the challenges associated with adopting networking models, specifically OpenConfig models, from three primary viewpoints: network engineers, internet service/content providers, and networking software/hardware vendors. We also discuss possible solutions via application of software modeling techniques to aid in the successful adoption of networking models.;;
Muñoz, P;Measuring the Fidelity of Digital Twin Systems;;;ACM/IEEE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS, MODELS 2022 COMPANION;;;A digital twin is a virtual replica of a system at a certain level of fidelity, synchronized at a specific frequency. Digital twins often replicate physical systems whose simulations are usually computationally costly. One of the solutions to this problem proposed in the literature is to define a hierarchy of multi-fidelity digital twins, where we use one twin or another depending on the specific purpose. However, one of the challenges of this proposal is the need to determine whether the different twins are equivalent to each other and the physical system. In this thesis, we explore different methods to measure this equivalence by analyzing the state and behavior of the twins with the aid of high-level software models.;;
"Yang X.; Liu X.; Zhang H.; Fu L.; Yu Y.";Meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin architecture, modeling and application;2023.0;;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;;;Digital twin is regarded as the virtual counterpart of physical entities, which can mirror the physical behavior and performance. Digital twin technology provides strong support for the achievement of cyber-physical system and intelligent manufacturing. Many investigations have been carried out for the digital twin of specific products. However, there are less researches on digital twin in the shop-floor domain, and there is a lack of model-driven digital twin comprehensive architecture. The modeling approach to the full lifecycle of digital twin is not considered enough. This paper proposes a meta-model-based shop-floor digital twin construction approach and a comprehensive architecture. A meta-model based on RAMI 4.0 is constructed, which provide a novel idea for the description of manufacturing resources and their status. The proposed shop-floor digital twin architecture consists of three key implementation elements: the meta-model construction, data modeling (including data interaction between cyber-physical spaces) and constructing different integration level models of shop-floor digital twin based on iteration feedback between the demands and models. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of the fischer learning factory 4.0. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;;

Primary issues in this area stem from the absence of standardization and the complexity and heterogeneity inherent to the IoT landscape. Model-Driven Development (MDD) is considered an effective technique for IoT application development. We argue that there is a need for methodologies of MDD that encompass system development and integration, as well as organizational aspects. To compensate for this lack, this work introduces MIoTA (Modeling IoT Applications for Air Conditioning Facilities), a modeling method supporting IoT application development in the field of air conditioning facilities. The ADOxx-based MIoTA tool was developed in an industrial use case. It contains a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) and various functionalities to support the modeling and development processes, so no specific IT skills are required at the application level. The approach has been evaluated practically within the case study and with quality criteria in previous work. Â© 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.;;

"Sartaj, H; Ali, S; Yue, T; Moberg, K";Model-based digital twins of medicine dispensers for healthcare IoT applications;;;SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE;;;Healthcare applications with the Internet of Things (IoT) are often safety-critical, thus, require extensive testing. Such applications are often connected to smart medical devices from various vendors. System-level testing of such applications requires test infrastructures physically integrating medical devices, which is time and monetary-wise expensive. Moreover, applications continuously evolve, for example, introducing new devices and users and updating software. Nevertheless, a test infrastructure enabling testing with a few devices is insufficient for testing healthcare IoT systems, hence compromising their dependability. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach for the creation and operation of digital twins (DTs) of medicine dispensers as a replacement for physical devices to support the automated testing of IoT applications at scale. We evaluate our approach with an industrial IoT system with medicine dispensers in the context of Oslo City and its industrial partners, providing healthcare services to its residents. We study the fidelity of DTs in terms of their functional similarities with their physical counterparts: medicine dispensers. Results show that the DTs behave more than 92% similar to the physical medicine dispensers, providing a faithful replacement for the dispenser.;;

This paper reports on bibliometric literature analysis of MBSE of IoT. It considers conference and journal publication trends in the state-of-the-art to identify emerging research themes from the standpoint of trans/multi-disciplinary scholarship and technology. We used Elsevierâs Scopus database to find relevant publications from January 2018 to December 2022. Using publication citation ranking and other factors (e.g., publication venues), we selected 110 articles and then analyzed them using BibExcel and VOSviewer software tools. With a modest decline in 2021, this analysis shows an overall increase in publications during the time period. A thematic analysis of the abstracts revealed a strong focus on the introduction of reference architectures and integration of MBSE with business and management methodologies like Agile and BPMN 2.0. Model-driven engineering and machine learning techniques are essential among the enablers for realization of complex heterogeneous IoT systems in the realm of Industry 4.0. We highlight these findings to better understand and meet the enduring challenge of scaling MBSE of IoT across diverse sectors like health, manufacturing, and transportation.;;

Since there is no practical way to instantaneously measure it at run time, a model is required for its estimation. Recently, several data-driven SOH models have been proposed, whose accuracy heavily relies on the quality of the datasets used for their training. Since these datasets are obtained from measurements, they are limited in the variety of the charge/discharge profiles. To address this scarcity issue, we propose generating datasets by simulating a traditional battery model (e.g., a circuit-equivalent one). The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to use a simulatable battery model to evaluate a potentially infinite number of workload profiles for training the data-driven model. Furthermore, this general concept can be applied using any simulatable battery model, providing a fine spectrum of accuracy/complexity tradeoffs. Our results indicate that using simulated data achieves reasonable accuracy in SOH estimation, with a 7.2% error relative to the simulated model, in exchange for a 27X memory reduction and a approximate to 2000X speedup.;;

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.;;

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins. © 2020 ACM.;;
"Visconti E.; Tsigkanos C.; Hu Z.; Ghezzi C.";Model-driven engineering city spaces via bidirectional model transformations;2021.0;;Software and Systems Modeling;;;"Engineering cyber-physical systems inhabiting contemporary urban spatial environments demands software engineering facilities to support design and operation. Tools and approaches in civil engineering and architectural informatics produce artifacts that are geometrical or geographical representations describing physical spaces. The models we consider conform to the CityGML standard; although relying on international standards and accessible in machine-readable formats, such physical space descriptions often lack semantic information that can be used to support analyses. In our context, analysis as commonly understood in software engineering refers to reasoning on properties of an abstracted modelin this case a city design. We support model-based development, firstly by providing a way to derive analyzable models from CityGML descriptions, and secondly, we ensure that changes performed are propagated correctly. Essentially, a digital twin of a city is kept synchronized, in both directions, with the information from the actual city. Specifically, our formal programming technique and accompanying technical framework assure that relevant information added, or changes applied to the domain (resp. analyzable) model are reflected back in the analyzable (resp. domain) model automatically and coherently. The technique developed is rooted in the theory of bidirectional transformations, which guarantees that synchronization between models is consistent and well behaved. Produced models can bootstrap graph-theoretic, spatial or dynamic analyses. We demonstrate that bidirectional transformations can be achieved in practice on real city models. © 2021, The Author(s).";;

The rising number of dynamically interconnected elements leads to an increasing complexity in such systems, which accompanies new challenges during systems engineering and thus leads to reaching the limits of contemporary methods. While the community has recognized this, new approaches recently arose to find solutions for particular parts of this problem. However, as the need for a holistic approach emerges, the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been standardized as a promising framework. While this domain-specific architecture framework is missing specifications to address all aspects of such critical infrastructure, this paper thus proposes a new modeling methodology promoting model-driven engineering (MDE) of current or future production systems based on the peculiarities of RAMI 4.0. To enable mutual architecture development across the entire system hierarchy and all stakeholders, the aspects of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) are considered. The proposed step-by-step guideline is thereby made applicable by a modeling framework called RAMI Toolbox that ensures the engineering of both greenfield and brownfield systems. Finally, the approach, including all artifacts, is evaluated based on a real-world case study proposed by Siemens.;;

Such Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) produce large amounts of data, which can be used to analyze the systemâs state and optimize its operation. To enable this analysis, the respective software components need to be interoperable with the CPPSs. While standards, such as OPC UA, provide interoperability on a technical protocol level, we see a vastly heterogeneous landscape of data models. Therefore, the integration of analysis components with their underlying CPPS is usually a laborious, manual process, also discouraging reuse. To facilitate the reuse of analysis software in this setting, we propose a model-driven method for integration with the underlying CPPS and the consumers of analysis results. Our contribution consists of (i) domain-specific languages for semantically enriched interface descriptions and simple mappings, (ii) a code generator toolchain to realize the specified mappings, and (iii) a simple, loosely coupled architecture for the resulting system.;;

Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations.

Commonly, a digital twin is defined based on a virtual entity (VE) that exhibits similar behavior to its physical counterpart, and that is coupled to this physical entity (PE). The VE thus forms a core part of any digital twin. While VEs may differ vastly - from ones based on simple simulation to high-fidelity virtual mirroring of the corresponding PE - they are typically composed of multiple models that may originate from multiple domains, address different aspects, and are expressed and processed using different tools and languages. Furthermore, the use of time series data - whether historical or real-time or both - from the PE distinguishes VEs from mere simulations. As a consequence of the modeling landscape complexity and the data aspect of VEs, the design of a digital twin and specifically of the VE as part of it represents several challenges.

In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT.

Digital twins are made possible using various technologies such as Internet of Things, sensor technology, artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning. With this, it represents a new stage in smart systems engineering. Developing digital twin-based systems necessitates a holistic system engineering approach in which modeling is critical. Various studies have been published on the notion of digital twins and its applications in various domains, but a modeling perspective has not been explicitly considered. Hence, this article provides a novel insight on the notion of digital twins from a modeling perspective, describing the evolution of modeling in engineering and likewise providing a rational basis for digital twins as a next logical step in modeling. A metamodel is provided that integrates the key concepts of systems engineering, digital twins, and modeling. While elaborating on the existing evolution of modeling in engineering, it is stated that the next step of digital twins will be artificial twins. Â© 2022 by the author.;;
Haverkort, BR;Performance Evaluation: Model-Driven or Problem-Driven?;;;QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF SYSTEMS (QEST 2021);;;In this paper I address the divide that has emerged between the field of performance evaluation and the field of computer and communication system design. After looking back briefly on the history of the field, I subsequently reflect on the reasons why the field of performance evaluation has become so isolated. I then continue with a set of eight recommendations, based on my experience in performing projects with industry, that will help in reconnecting, and that will result in a better uptake of the newest techniques and tools in the field of design of computer and communication systems. Following these recommendations will probably push scientists a little out of their comfort zone, however, I feel the potential extra reward of seeing our work truly applied is more than worth it.;;
"Stennikov, V; Barakhtenko, E; Sokolov, D; Mayorov, G";Principles of Building Digital Twins to Design Integrated Energy Systems;2022.0;;COMPUTATION;;10.3390/computation10120222;The design of integrated energy systems (IESs) is a challenging task by reason of the highly complex configurations of these systems, the wide range of equipment used, and a diverse set of mathematical models and dedicated software employed to model it. The use of digital twins allows modeling in virtual space for various IES configurations. As a result, an optimal option of IES is obtained, which is implemented in the construction or expansion of a real-world IES. The paper proposes the principles of building digital twins for solving the IES design problems. The paper presents a new methodological approach developed by the authors to design an IES with the help of its digital twin. This approach includes the following components: the architecture of the software platform to create digital twins, a set of technologies and tools to implement the platform, methods to automatically construct a digital twin based on the Model-Driven Engineering concept, an algorithm to design an IES based on its digital twin, and principles to organize a computational process using a multi-agent approach. The results of the computational experiment using the software implementation of the IES digital twin components are presented for a test energy supply scheme.;;

The miscellaneous IIoT sensors deployed for DSM are distributed and operate in a hierarchical and federated structure. Nonetheless, fulfilling essential quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as ensuring security and privacy (integrity) while maintaining scalability and interoperability (robustness), poses a profound challenge for the DSM cloud service platform. Although blockchain technologies have been used to safeguard integrity, the first two generations have imposed constraints on robustness. In contrast, the third-generation blockchain, a.k.a. decentralized crosschain ecosystem, complements Web 3.0 and metaverse and can mitigate the constraints of previous generations. Moreover, blockchain-based ad hoc solutions for DSM use cases are abundant; they often suffer from limited adaptability and unique or homogeneous use cases from a software engineering perspective. A holistic architectural modeling process (AMP) leading to a software reference architecture (SRA) is preferred when alleviating ad hoc constraints. Therefore, we proposed an AMP for SRA for crosschain-based DSM that safeguards integrity while preserving robustness. In the work described in this article, we have conducted the following systemâmodeling process. First, we propose a novel software AMP for DSM. Second, we deduce a modeled SRA based on a crosschain. Third, we infer a modeled system architecture (SA). Empirical experiment results demonstrate that our proposed crosschain-based method outperforms the widely used on-chain-based method while achieving our objectives efficiently.";;

Intricate models complicate the definition of comprehensive testing criteria, and physical couplings make obtaining test data an arduous task. To alleviate these challenges, we explore the use of causal inference based testing and propose a technique to allow for correct behaviour of digital twins to be captured in causal diagrams, which are then tested with an efficient data set through the use of counterfactuals. We explore a motivating example of a robotic arm to show how this technique can confirm known causal relationships in a system, and even uncover a fault in the system which caused dangerous behaviour. Our technique localised this erroneous behaviour to a single causal relationship between two variables. Having shown this technique works with a case study, we explore its limitations and the challenges when approaching other industrial applications.;;

These models are specified using dedicated, oftentimes graphical modeling languages. This includes general purpose languages such as SysML or UML which may be tailored to specific domains, and domain-specific languages with a much narrower scope. Either way, the specification of graphical modeling languages and the construction of MDE environments supporting these languages is centered on the definition of a meta-model. Meta-models capture the relevant domain abstractions and concepts by specifying the abstract syntax and static semantics of a graphical modeling language, while the concrete syntax definition, layouting principles and user interactions for model editing are only superficially addressed. This observation holds both for the current state-of-practice and the academic literature, and is at odds with the domain studied in this paper, namely the graphical modeling of real-world technical systems. Our practical observation and central hypothesis is that, in this domain, human factors should be primary concern for the design of domain-specific languages and environments, which enable domain experts to understand, create and edit their models much more efficiently and effectively. As basis for further discussion at the workshop, we report on our ongoing work to develop a technical approach and research methodology to validate this hypothesis in future empirical studies.;;

A particular challenge in this context is insufficient guidance for operators on how to resolve issues and adapt their actions to a new production context. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can help to identify and address likely causes of production quality issues. However, FMEA models are typically (i) isolated from engineering domain models on product, process and resource (PPR) concerns, and (ii) not actionable for operators. This paper introduces the FMEA-to-Operation (F2O) approach to reduce the risk of ramp-up delays and recurring quality issues by integrating the required domain knowledge for model-driven, machine skill-centric, and actionable process FMEA. The F2O approach (i) validates likely root causes of a production quality issue by linking these causes to engineering reality in a graph database, and (ii) derives operation checklists with prioritized countermeasures. In a feasibility study on a real-world welding cell for car parts, we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the F2O approach. Results indicate that the F2O approach is feasible and effective, and provides operators with actionable, context-specific guidelines that are well grounded in engineering models.;;

This requires highly adaptive, versatile cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs), which react flexibly to changes and perform crucial adjustments. Self-adaptive digital twins (DTs) enable adaptability through monitoring the behavior of a CPPS, identifying problems, and determining adjustments for the optimization of processes. DTs work with an idealized representation of the CPPS. Changes in system behavior that negatively impact the process execution, e.g., caused by tool wear or variations of environmental influences, and, thus, the quality of the resulting product, are ignored. This ignorance leads to defective products, sub-optimal product quality, and hazardous CPPS states. To mitigate this, we present an approach to incorporate quality awareness into a model-driven reference architecture of a self-adaptive DT. The devised concept automatically analyzes and optimizes system behavior. To this end, a component for quality evaluation extends the reference architecture. The DT and CPPS are connected via OPC UA. To validate the approach, a fiber laser machine is utilized. The DT can operate both on a physical and a virtual laser machine. Â© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the 'Papyrus for Manufacturing' toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning.

This study explored the use of free and open-source software to generate an LOD1 and LOD2 3D city model of Tanauan City, Batangas using building footprints from OpenStreetMap and elevation models from Taal Open LiDAR data. The proposed approach consists of GIS-based methods including data pre-processing, building height extraction, roof identification, building reconstruction, and visualization. The study adopted methods from previous studies for building detection and from Zheng et al. (2017) for LOD2 building reconstruction. For LOD1, a decision tree classifier was devised to determine the appropriate height for building extrusion. For LOD2, a model-driven approach using multipatch surfaces was utilized for building reconstruction. The workflow was able to reconstruct 70.66% LOD1 building models and 55.87% LOD2 building models with 44.37% overall accuracy. The RMSE and MAE between the extracted heights from the workflow and from manual digitization has an accuracy lower than 1âm which was within the standards of CityGML. The processing time in test bench 1 and test bench 2 for LOD1 took 00:12:54.5 and 00:09:27.2 while LOD2 took 02:50:29.1 and 01:27:48.2, respectively. The results suggest that the efficient generation of LOD1 and LOD2 3D city models from open data can be achieved in the FOSS environment using less computationally intensive GIS-based algorithms.

"Laukotka, FN; Krause, D";Supporting Digital Twins for the Retrofit in Aviation by a Model-Driven Data Handling;2023.0;;SYSTEMS;;10.3390/systems11030142;Aviation is characterized by many stakeholders, long lifespans of its assets, and high requirements regarding safety, security, and documentation. To meet these requirements as well as customer needs, aircraft are regularly retrofitted with new cabins. During the planning and execution of this cabin retrofit, handling the needed and available data poses a challenge to the engineers. While much of the required data is available in some form, generally there is a lack of a digitally usable dataset of the specific aircraft-a virtual representation of the physical asset is missing. To support the implementation of such a digital twin and, thus, the overall process of retrofitting aircraft, an approach to model-driven data handling tailored to the unique circumstances and requirements of aviation is introduced. The methodology consists of a combination of systems engineering and data science techniques framed by an overarching procedure that iteratively creates and enhances a digitally accessible dataset of the relevant data, hence supporting the retrofit engineers by easing access to needed information. Besides the presentation of the research background and the methodology, a simplified example is shown, demonstrating the approach using abstracted but realistic information provided by partners from the industry.;;

Closely related to this topic arises the concept of Digital Twin, which is a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes that connect to the physical counterpart to represent, simulate, or predict changes in the physical system. There are many works that focus on supporting the high-fidelity implementation of Digital Twins for specific physical devices. However, few of them consider the process as a real-world entity to be integrated into the Digital Twin. In this work, we present a microservice architecture to support the implementation of Digital Twins for IoT-Enhanced Business Processes, considering not only the physical devices but also the process itself and the relationship among them. This architectural solution is supported by a model-driven development approach, which proposes (1) the construction of a BPMN model to represent an IoT-enhanced Business Process and (2) the application of model transformation to automatically generate both Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) models and microservice Java code templates. DTDL models are used in the implementation of the Digital Twins for the IoT-Enhanced Business Process. Java code templates are used to facilitate the implementation of the microservices required to deploy the IoT-enhanced Business Process and its Digital Twins into the proposed architecture and maintain the digital and physical parts synchronised.

Then, based on modern information technology, we proposed the architecture and deployment method of the intelligent substation digital twin system. The proposed system consists of a data collection layer, a model driven layer, and a twin application layer, which respectively elaborate on the specific content and advantages, and supplement the complete deployment method of the system. The intelligent substation digital twin system effectively promotes the digitization and intelligence of substations, providing a new construction and management mode, and has potential application prospects in promoting equipment status perception, deterioration trend analysis, and fault handling in the power industry.;;

However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.;;

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) help them to bridge the conceptual gap between the problem and the solution domain. Engineering these languages is complex, as it requires comprehensive white-box knowledge of constituents of DSLs, i.e., syntax and semantics, and their composition and realization in respective technological spaces of language workbenches. For efficient language engineering reusing existing languages by composition is essential. For this purpose, various language composition and variability mechanisms have been developed. However, in the literature, there exists no approach enabling systematic language reuse holistically, i.e., including syntax and semantics, in a black-box fashion. We propose an approach for the systematic component-oriented reuse of DSLs (SCOLaR) that supports the integrated reuse of syntax, well-formedness rules, and semantics via black-box language components that are composable along their interface in a language family. We implemented a prototypical version of our solution with the MontiCore language workbench, that supports embedding and aggregation of grammar-based languages with translational semantics realized with code-generators. In the future, we plan to improve our implementation with the support of other language workbenches and to provide a comprehensive evaluation with a series of case studies. With our work, we aim to advance the field of software language engineering by providing a novel method for black-box language reuse capturing syntax and semantics definitions for textual external, translational DSLs. This paper outlines our approach by stating the problem, motivating our research question, and proposing our solution, our plan for evaluation, and presenting expected contributions.;;

The cyber-physical system (CPS) has the property of intellectuality, scalability, adaptability, and openness, making it suitable for machine tool monitoring. The current data-driven CPS method is prone to interpretability and generalization limitations due to the empirical selection of hyper-parameters in the model and the need for heterogeneous data. On the other hand, traditional model-driven systems are difficult to adjust models to practical working conditions data due to empirical equations constructed by offline data. This article proposes a novel model-driven cyber-physical system (MDCPS) to overcome these weaknesses. First, the physical model generates a counterpart of the machining process to form a cyber world, and sensors depict the real-time state of the machining process to form a physical world. Second, for deep fusion between the cyber and physical worlds, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach is applied to calibrate the empirical model with online measured data. Third, the model-based diagnosis and prediction methods are used for online monitoring and control. Case studies of MDCPS for machining monitoring are presented to prove the feasibility of this model-driven system.;;

"Bariah, L; Debbah, M";The Interplay of AI and Digital Twin: Bridging the Gap between Data-Driven and Model-Driven Approaches;;;IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS;;;The evolution of network virtualization and native artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms have conceptualized the vision of future wireless networks as a comprehensive entity operating in whole over a digital platform with smart interaction with the physical domain, paving the way for the blooming of the Digital Twin (DT) concept. The recent interest in the DT networks is fueled by the emergence of novel wireless technologies and use-cases that exacerbate the level of complexity to orchestrate the network and to manage its resources. Driven by AI, the key principle of the DT is to create a virtual twin for the physical entities and network dynamics where the virtual twin will be leveraged to generate synthetic data and offer an on-demand platform for AI model training. Despite the common understanding that AI is the seed for DT, we anticipate that the DT and AI will be enablers for each other in a way that overcomes their limitations and complements each others' benefits. In this article, we dig into the fundamentals of DT, where we reveal the role of DT in unifying model- and data-driven approaches, and explore the opportunities offered by DT in order to achieve the optimistic vision of 6G networks. We further unfold the essential role of the theoretical underpinnings in unlocking further opportunities by AI, and hence, we unveil their pivotal impact on the realization of reliable, efficient, and low-latency DT.;;

One of the core value propositions is a dedicated Digital Innovation environment comprising several toolkits and workspaces, designed to support Product-Service Systems (PSS) prototyping  a key ingredient for PSS lifecycle management. At the core of this environment is a notion of Agile Digital Twin  a conceptual representation that can be tailored with knowledge engineering means to bridge the semantic and functional gap between a business perspective (focusing on value creation) and an engineering perspective (focusing on cyber-physical proofs-of-concept). To facilitate this bridging, the hereby proposed environment orchestrates, across three abstraction layers, methods such as Design Thinking, Agile Modeling Method Engineering and Model-driven Engineering to turn Ideation into smart Product-Service Systems experiments, in a laboratory setting. The proposed environment was built following Design Science principles. It addresses the problem of historically-disconnected skills required for Digital Innovation projects and it provides a testbed for feasibility experimentation.

LCDPs typically support specific application types and domains such as web applications, mobile applications, data analytics platforms and dashboards. While some LCDPs exist for control systems in the manufacturing industry, this domain is not yet fully supported. In this paper, we present a multiple-case study based on five interviews to explore the role LCDPs can play in industrial automation. In particular, we investigate which use cases are considered relevant for LCDPs and what the actual requirements for such platforms are from an industrial perspective. Our results show that many different manufacturing use cases could be implemented by or already benefit from LCDPs.

With modelling gaining traction for analysis-heavy use cases like decision-making and regulatory compliance where domain experts play a central role, this barrier is beginning to hurt even more. We posit that Generative AI techniques can significantly lower this barrier by enabling domain experts to construct purposive models by operating at natural language level. This requires domain experts to interact with Generative AI tools using the right purpose-specific contextual prompts. We propose a model-driven approach where purposive meta models guide the interactions between domain expert and Generative AI to generate such prompts. The proposed approach helps in overcoming some of the limitations of Generative AI such as missing local context, limited context window size, attention fading etc. Industry scale models are typically large, necessitating a team of experts to work in a coordinated manner which requires sharing of outputs and persistence across sessions. Our approach brings together MDE and Generative AI in a symbiotic relationship complimenting respective strengths and overcoming limitations. We have validated this approach for development of digital twin based applications and early results are encouraging.;;

This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.  © 2020 ACM.;;
"Paredis, R; Vangheluwe, H";Towards a Digital Z Framework Based on a Family of Architectures and a Virtual Knowledge Graph;;;ACM/IEEE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS, MODELS 2022 COMPANION;;;The purpose of systems engineering is to, often collaboratively and following complex workflows, analyse, design, optimize, operate, and evolve complex, cyber-physical systems. This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of experiments which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow. We sketch the above concepts by means of concrete examples and compare them with existing Digital Z definitions and frameworks such as the 5D model.;;

One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS's behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models""are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models.

We then reflect on the nature of the models and their uses and meaning, from the point of view of the comments and questions we receive in the demonstrations. We also consider the use of a feature-based approach to modelling the systems and their interactions, which is a further aspect for which the demonstrator could be used, with a special attention to the aspects of this work, like AAL and the feature based and feature interaction research, that connect directly with the collaboration with and the research of Bengt Jonsson. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;;

While specific benefits depend on the individual applications, speech interfaces typically increase accessibility, enable 'hands-free' and 'no-screen' interaction, and often increase interaction speed and allow for more flexible usage patterns and increased multitasking, leading to higher user satisfaction. This paper presents a method to transfer these powerful benefits to the digital twin (DT) domain by automatically generating speech interfaces for DT applications. Our approach is based on Model Driven Engineering principles, where we automatically deduce command patterns from structural model information as used in, e.g., DT platform specifications. The speech interface generation is highly configurable and extendable, thus it can be applied to different DT models. The concepts behind the generator are generic as well, thus they can be ported to other applications and platforms. We validate our approach by applying it to two DT demonstration cases and provide a detailed description of the sketch interface configuration workflow.  Â© 2023 IEEE.;;
"Bordeleau F.; Combemale B.; Eramo R.; van den Brand M.; Wimmer M.";Towards Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering: Current Opportunities and Future Challenges;2020.0;;Communications in Computer and Information Science;;;Digital Twins have emerged since the beginning of this millennium to better support the management of systems based on (real-time) data collected in different parts of the operating systems. Digital Twins have been successfully used in many application domains, and thus, are considered as an important aspect of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). However, their development, maintenance, and evolution still face major challenges, in particular: (i) the management of heterogeneous models from different disciplines, (ii) the bi-directional synchronization of digital twins and the actual systems, and (iii) the support for collaborative development throughout the complete life-cycle. In the last decades, the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) community has investigated these challenges in the context of software systems. Now the question arises, which results may be applicable for digital twin engineering as well. In this paper, we identify various MDE techniques and technologies which may contribute to tackle the three mentioned digital twin challenges as well as outline a set of open MDE research challenges that need to be addressed in order to move towards a digital twin engineering discipline. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;;

Harnessing the power of twinning to cyber-physical systems offers several benefits and opportunities, that are encountered by multiple challenges. Data integration, knowledge representation, reasoning, and inferencing are crucial for providing dependable services to the twinned systems. To address these challenges, an ontology-enabled approach for modelling cyber-physical systems and their twins is proposed, which is incorporated with an intelligent agent-driven representation of the different elements of the system. Applied to a case study, this approach enables representing the knowledge of the system and its environment, capturing different aspects and integrating heterogeneous data from various sources. This allows performing reasoning and inferencing on the system to obtain valuable insights and information.;;
"Eisenberg M.; Lehner D.; Sindelar R.; Wimmer M.";Towards Reactive Planning withDigital Twins and Model-Driven Optimization;2022.0;;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);;;Digital Twins are emerging in several domains. They allow to connect various models with running systems based on bi-directional data exchange. Thus, design models can be extended with runtime views which also opens the door for many additional techniques such as identifying unexpected system changes during runtime. However, dedicated reactions to these unexpected changes, such as adapting an existing plan which has been computed in advance and may no longer be seen beneficial, are still often neglected in Digital Twins. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose so-called reactive planning that integrates Digital Twins with planning approaches to react to unforeseen changes during plan execution. In particular, we introduce an extended Digital Twin architecture which allows to integrate existing model-driven optimization frameworks. Based on this integration, we present different strategies how the replanning can be performed by utilizing the information and services available in Digital Twins. We evaluate our approach for a stack allocation case study. This evaluation yields promising results on how to effectively improve existing plans during runtime, but also allows to identify future lines of research in this area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;;

The former is referred to as horizontal- and the latter as vertical interoperability. This paper proposes ways to improve interoperability using multi-level and multi-view modelling methods. Multi-level modelling maximizes the reuse of information at the high-level and reduces complexity at the same time by separation of concerns. Multi-view modelling also allows to reduce complexity by selecting a subset of model elements required by a stakeholder. Currently there is no effective modelling approach that can adequately combine both methods. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling approach that integrates multi-level and multi-view modelling to support the collaborative evolution of multi-level models by different stakeholders. We present the metamodel and a semi-formal definition of the approach and demonstrate its benefits in the context of a risk management case study from the energy industry.;;

Process optimization based on digital twin is considered as an intelligent method to link machining process and process design, which is benefit to the scientific control of machining quality. This paper summarizes the evolution and development of process model and proposes twin process model, which could support the machining quality optimization of complex parts. What's more, industrial application of twin process model is introduced through three steps, namely mapping relationship between machine operation data and instruction domain, simulation and monitoring of machining surface roughness, and optimization of machining parameter based on twin process model. Finally, the proposed twin process model could provide theoretical support for machining quality control. © 2021 IEEE.;;

Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS. In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems. We illustrate our contribution using a Digital Twins case study to illustrate TwinOps benefits, combining AADL and Modelica models, and an IoT platform.  Â© 2020 ACM.;;

To address this difficulty, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the tensor completion method by about 12.5% and 92.3%, respectively, in terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.;;

Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system's executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system's environment based on the data recorded by the system's digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study. By facilitating the reproduction of the system's behavior, our method lowers the barrier to understanding the behavior of model-driven IoT systems.  © 2021 ACM.;;

A core component of a DT is the virtual entity (VE) that is meant to 'mirror' the physical entity (PE). A particular challenge for developing this VE is the integration between the different models that typically make up such a VE. These models, covering different disciplines or aspects of a system, commonly are developed by different engineers and expressed in different formalisms given their strengths and weaknesses. This makes integration between these models and formalisms a challenge. Such integration has two aspects: the communication among the models, and their orchestration, which concerns the order of model step execution and data exchange. In this paper, we consider the suitability of Ptolemy II, an open source framework based on an actor-oriented structure, to implement such integration. We use the Ptolemy II framework to reproduce the implementation of a DT of an autonomous scaled-down truck, which originally required a more manual configuration and execution and was developed in a monolithic way. The results show that Ptolemy II can be used to implement different communication technologies as actors, and show the expressiveness of the orchestrators by reproducing the existing DT's behavior. This shows Ptolemy II in principle to be suitable as an integration and orchestration tool for models in the context of DTs. As future work, we plan to apply the framework to more complex DTs using different communication technologies, so as to validate its broader suitability for VE orchestration in DTs. © 2021 IEEE.;;
