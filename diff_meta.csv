A MODEL-DRIVEN APPROACH FOR SITUATIONAL INTELLIGENCE & OPERATIONAL AWARENESS;2019 PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CONFERENCE EUROPE (PCIC EUROPE);"Shokooh, S; Nordvik, G";;C;;In order to design, operate, and maintain an oil and gas facility, one must first understand its behavior. A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely. Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a digital twin of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system. A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation. This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.
Supporting Digital Twins for the Retrofit in Aviation by a Model-Driven Data Handling;SYSTEMS;"Laukotka, FN; Krause, D";;J;;Aviation is characterized by many stakeholders, long lifespans of its assets, and high requirements regarding safety, security, and documentation. To meet these requirements as well as customer needs, aircraft are regularly retrofitted with new cabins. During the planning and execution of this cabin retrofit, handling the needed and available data poses a challenge to the engineers. While much of the required data is available in some form, generally there is a lack of a digitally usable dataset of the specific aircraft-a virtual representation of the physical asset is missing. To support the implementation of such a digital twin and, thus, the overall process of retrofitting aircraft, an approach to model-driven data handling tailored to the unique circumstances and requirements of aviation is introduced. The methodology consists of a combination of systems engineering and data science techniques framed by an overarching procedure that iteratively creates and enhances a digitally accessible dataset of the relevant data, hence supporting the retrofit engineers by easing access to needed information. Besides the presentation of the research background and the methodology, a simplified example is shown, demonstrating the approach using abstracted but realistic information provided by partners from the industry.
GRuM-A flexible model-driven runtime monitoring framework and its application to automated aerial and ground vehicles;JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE;"Vierhauser, M; Garmendia, A; Stadler, M; Wimmer, M; Cleland-Huang, J";;J;;Runtime monitoring is critical for ensuring safe operation and for enabling self-adaptive behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Monitors are established by identifying runtime properties of interest, creating probes to instrument the system, and defining constraints to be checked at runtime. For many systems, implementing and setting up a monitoring platform can be tedious and time-consuming, as generic monitoring platforms do not adequately cover domain-specific monitoring requirements. This situation is exacerbated when the System under Monitoring (SuM) evolves, requiring changes in the monitoring platform. Most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for dealing with system evolution. In this paper, we present GRuM (Generating CPS Runtime Monitors), a framework that combines model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring, to automatically generate a customized monitoring platform for a given SuM. Relevant properties are captured in a Domain Model Fragment, and changes to the SuM can be easily accommodated by automatically regenerating the platform code. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance we evaluated GRuM against two different systems using TurtleBot robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Results show that GRuM facilitates the creation and evolution of a runtime monitoring platform with little effort and that the platform can handle a substantial amount of events and data.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

On the Notion of Digital Twins: A Modeling Perspective;SYSTEMS;Tekinerdogan, B;;J;;A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical entity that can be remotely controlled, which allows for sophisticated control for a variety of reasons. Digital twins are made possible using various technologies such as Internet of Things, sensor technology, artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning. With this, it represents a new stage in smart systems engineering. Developing digital twin-based systems necessitates a holistic system engineering approach in which modeling is critical. Various studies have been published on the notion of digital twins and its applications in various domains, but a modeling perspective has not been explicitly considered. Hence, this article provides a novel insight on the notion of digital twins from a modeling perspective, describing the evolution of modeling in engineering and likewise providing a rational basis for digital twins as a next logical step in modeling. A metamodel is provided that integrates the key concepts of systems engineering, digital twins, and modeling. While elaborating on the existing evolution of modeling in engineering, it is stated that the next step of digital twins will be artificial twins.
A Comparative Study on Digital Twin Models;ADVANCES IN MATERIALS, MACHINERY, ELECTRONICS III;"Liu, Q; Liu, B; Wang, G; Zhang, C";;C;;As the main concept, the Digital Twin (DT) shows its potential not only in industry 4.0 but also in other areas. One of the keys that decide the future of DT been known as its model technology. Through models can integrate features, behaviors, and properties of DT artifacts with efficiency, reusability, and interoperability, in order to build a complete mapping between the physical world and digital world, after that realize the ideal DT. This paper aims at comparing and analyzing the DT models in the scientific literature, retracing them from the initial one to the models in most recent researches. Thus, this study also emphasizes several principles of the DT model technology that is related to future work.
EMF-Syncer: scalable maintenance of view models over heterogeneous data-centric software systems at run time;SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING;Boronat, A;;J;;With the increasing presence of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), like autonomous vehicle systems and digital twins, the future of software engineering is predicated on the importance of designing and developing data-centric software systems that can adapt intelligently at run time. CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems.
Digital modeling-driven chatter suppression for thin-walled part manufacturing;JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING;"Zhou, G; Zhou, K; Zhang, J; Yuan, M; Wang, XH; Feng, PF; Zhang, M; Feng, F";;J;;Thin-walled parts are widely used in various industries such as aerospace and automotive, but the manufacturing processes are often harmed by chatter which is a self-excited vibration because of the poor rigidity in the direction perpendicular to the wall surface. The traditional stability lobe diagram (SLD) method can predict chatter based on the manufacturing system and workpiece parameters. However, these parameters could vary along with the manufacturing execution, compromising SLD's accuracy and even feasibility. To enable effective chatter suppression in thin-walled part milling, this study proposes a digital twin model, where two sub-models including the cutting parameters optimization and chatter detection are established. In the sub-model of cutting parameters optimization, a real-time SLD considering the time-varying modal parameters at the cutting region of the workpiece is generated as the optimization criteria. The sub-model of chatter detection can recognize chatter by a fusional analysis of the multiple sensors' signals, including vibration, force, and sound. Considering the bias of real-time SLD, these two sub-models are combined to output optimized cutting parameters to avoid chatter. Besides, a monitoring window to visualize the milling scenario and a database to record the manufacturing data are implemented in the digital twin model. According to the milling experiments, the digital twin model is validated to perform more effectively in chatter suppression than the traditional stationary SLD method.
Potential and limitations of digital twins to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals;NATURE SUSTAINABILITY;"Tzachor, A; Sabri, S; Richards, CE; Rajabifard, A; Acuto, M";;J;;Could computer simulation models drive our ambitions to sustainability in urban and non-urban environments? Digital twins, defined here as real-time, virtual replicas of physical and biological entities, may do just that. However, despite their touted potential, digital twins have not been examined critically in urban sustainability paradigms-not least in the Sustainable Development Goals framework. Accordingly, in this Perspective, we examine their benefits in promoting the Sustainable Development Goals. Then, we discuss critical limitations when modelling socio-technical and socio-ecological systems and go on to discuss measures to treat these limitations and design inclusive, reliable and responsible computer simulations for achieving sustainable development. Little is known about the potential of digital twins in the pursuit of sustainability. This study examines the likely benefits of digital twins in urban sustainability paradigms, their limitations when modelling socio-technical and socio-ecological systems and possible ways to attenuate them.
Interactive Smart Space for Single-Person Households Using Electroencephalogram through Fusion of Digital Twin and Artificial Intelligence;ENERGIES;Ji, SY;;J;;The core technology for building a smart space includes the capability to analyse the space for users using various sensors. The purpose of this study was to propose a personalised interactive smart space implementation model driven by the fusion of digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data. This study utilised a handheld EEG sensor to identify a user's emotion information and focused on the connection with the space. A smart space for single-person households that responds to EEG-based biometric information was designed for an interactive space that can improve the current emotional state of the space user. The technical characteristics of DT and AI were analysed to control spatial changes according to the user's emotional state and to address safety-related issues. Furthermore, a fusion mechanism for DT and AI was developed for intelligent motor control to change the dimensions of the space in order to improve the EEG state of the user. In addition, using an AI model that converts EEG data into emotional state information, the user's emotional state was analysed, and key issues related to the spatial dimensions and change of space that induce psychological stability were investigated.
Urban Intelligence: toward the Digital Twin of Matera and Catania;2022 WORKSHOP ON BLOCKCHAIN FOR RENEWABLES INTEGRATION (BLORIN);"Castelli, G; Cesta, A; Ciampi, M; De Benedictis, R; De Pietro, G; Diez, M; Felici, G; Malvezzi, R; Masini, B; Pellegrini, R; Scalas, A; Stecca, G; Strambini, L; Tognola, G; Ravazzani, P; Campana, EF";;C;;The Urban Intelligence (UI) paradigm conceived by CNR consists of an ecosystem of digital technologies joined within a Digital Twin (DT) of the city aimed at improving the city governance towards goals addressed also by the UN Agenda 2030, such as urban environment, sustainability and resilience, wellbeing and quality of life, local development, and social inclusion. In particular, UI provides a set of candidate policies in complex scenarios, and supports policy makers and stakeholders in designing shared, evidence-based, and integrated solutions. UI is being applied for the first time to two Italian cities, Matera and Catania, paving the way for a deeper scientific framing of the paradigm, as well as for the technological development and testing of the core UI ecosystem in real-life situations. The paper introduces the UI key-concepts and components, illustrates the ongoing experimentations in these pilot cities related to the development of two DTs on parts of the urban areas, and presents some initial results.
A data- and model-driven approach for cancer treatment;ONKOLOGE;"Schade, S; Ogilvie, LA; Kessler, T; Schutte, M; Wierling, C; Lange, BM; Lehrach, H; Yaspo, ML";;J;;"All people are unique and so are their diseases. Our genomes, disease histories, behavior, and lifestyles are all different; therefore it is not too surprising that people often respond differently when administered the same drugs. Cancer, in particular, is a complex and heterogeneous disease, originating in patients with different genomes, in cells with the different epigenomes, formed and evolving on the basis of random processes, with the response to therapy not only depending on the individual cancer cell but also on many features of the patient. Selection of an optimal therapy will therefore require a deep molecular analysis comprising both the patient and their tumor (e.g., comprehensive molecular tumor analysis [CMTA]), and much better personalized prediction of response to possible therapies. Currently, we are at an inflection point in which advances in technology, decreases in the costs of sequencing and other molecular analyses, and increases in computing advances are converging, forming the foundation to build a data-driven approach to personalized oncology. In this article we discuss the deep molecular characterization of individual tumors and patients as the basis of not only current precision oncology but also of computational models ('digital twins'), the foundation for a truly personalized therapy selection of the future."
Digital Twin Driven Green Performance Evaluation Methodology of Intelligent Manufacturing: Hybrid Model Based on Fuzzy Rough-Sets AHP, Multistage Weight Synthesis, and PROMETHEE II;COMPLEXITY;"Li, LH; Mao, CL; Sun, HX; Yuan, YP; Lei, BB";;J;;The design, planning, and implementation of intelligent manufacturing are mainly carried out from the perspectives of meeting the needs of mass customization, improving manufacturing capacity, and innovating business pattern currently. Environmental and social factors should be systematically integrated into the life cycle of intelligent manufacturing. In view of this, a green performance evaluation methodology of intelligent manufacturing driven by digital twin is proposed in this paper. Digital twin framework, which constructs the bidirectional mapping and real-time data interaction between physical entity and digital model, provides the green performance evaluation with a total factor virtual image of the whole life cycle to meet the monitoring and simulation requirements of the evaluation information source and demand. Driven by the digital twin framework, a novel hybrid MCDM model based on fuzzy rough-sets AHP, multistage weight synthesis, and PROMETHEE II is proposed as the methodology for the green performance evaluation of intelligent manufacturing. The model is tested and validated on a study of the green performance evaluation of remote operation and maintenance service project evaluation for an air conditioning enterprise. Testing demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model driven by digital twin can enable a stable and reasonable evaluation result. A sensitivity analysis was carried out by means of 27 scenarios, the results of which showed a high degree of stability.

A digital twin-driven hybrid approach for the prediction of performance degradation in transmission unit of CNC machine tool;ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING;"Yang, X; Ran, Y; Zhang, GB; Wang, HW; Mu, ZY; Zhi, SG";;J;;Precision performance prediction of transmission system is considered as a key technology to modern equipment health management. Given the importance of maintaining a transmission system's precision, this paper presents a hybrid approach framework driven by digital twin technology (DT), to predict performance degradation. Firstly, a DT model based on meta-action theory is established, and real-time monitoring and digital simulation, driven by DT data, is realized in order to analyze the precision of the transmission units in machine tools. Secondly, the wear of gear in transmission unit is studied through Achard wear theory, which considered the comprehensive influence of gear load and speed on surface wear of the gear pair tooth, based on the model driving method. The performance degradation of the transmission unit is obtained by using the RBF neural network algorithm based on the data-driven method to extrapolate the wear data to the field-measurable precision index value. In addition, the hybrid predictive approach of the performance degradation model through the particle filter algorithm is built, and the real-time data is used to update the current state estimation to improve the prediction accuracy. By combining the mechanism of the physical degradation processes with the real-time and historical data and turning them into a cooperative architecture, this prediction method uses the complementary advantages offered by the fusion of these methods to bridge the link between data-driven prediction and model-based prediction. Finally, the method has been successfully applied to the precision prediction of the transmission unit in CNCMT turntable, and it is compared with the single prediction method to verify the effectiveness and feasibility.
A multi-model ensemble digital twin solution for real-time unsteady flow state estimation of a pumping station;ISA TRANSACTIONS;"He, L; Wen, K; Gong, J; Wu, CC";;J;;This paper proposes a digital twin solution for unsteady flow state estimation in a pumping station. Digital twin is expected to accurately estimate the real-time hydraulic parameters of blind spots of the pumping station system even under some adverse conditions including the interference of observation noise and model parameters drift. To solve these challenges, a digital twin framework integrating the model-driven method, control theory and data-driven method is presented. In this framework, an unsteady flow state estimation method combining frequency domain analysis and generalized predictive control theory is developed for the first time, which is superior to traditional time-domain numerical discrete methods in terms of computational efficiency and anti-noise interference. In the model parameter calibration process, the novelty concerns modeling of the optimization problem considering the dynamic operation control of the station and unsteady flow of pipelines. And this process is accomplished through the comprehensive application of the model-free adaptive control algorithm, the transient flow model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. This work is applied to a pumping station in a product pipeline to verify its effectiveness in estimating the transient flow state of data blind spots and map the dynamic operation behavior under the interference of colored noise and parameter drift.

A New Modeling Approach for Power Grid Online Analysis;IFAC PAPERSONLINE;"Zhou, MK; Feng, DH";;C;;A new modeling approach for power grid online analysis is proposed to support the realization of a new online analysis system architecture. The model-driven software development, automatic code generation, and in-memory computing techniques are employed in the modeling approach. Data source adapters are developed for the integration of the model with the existing EMS system. A large-scale power grid online network data model (similar to 40K-bus) is used for the model performance testing in a Lab environment. The proposed modeling approach was used to develop a new online analysis application, which was deployed and running in a provincial grid dispatching control center. The Lab and field performance measurement shows that the modeling approach-based application can achieve second-order end-to-end responsiveness. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.
Simulation-Based Engineering of Heterogeneous Collaborative Systems-A Novel Conceptual Framework;SUSTAINABILITY;"Perisic, A; Perisic, I; Perisic, B";;J;;We discuss the collaboration support of loosely coupled Smart Systems through configurable hyper-frameworks. Based on the system-of-systems (SoS) paradigm, in this article, we propose the model of a novel extendible conceptual framework with domain-specific moderation support for model-based simulations and the engineering of complex heterogeneous systems. The domain knowledge meta-model and corresponding management enterprise architecture enable the creation of template-based specializations. The proposed SoS conceptual framework meta-model represents an initial framework prototype that supports modeling, simulation, analysis, and utilization of dynamic architecting of heterogeneous SoS configurations. A Smart-Habitat concept encapsulating Smart-Area, Smart-City, Smart-Lot, Smart-Building, and Smart-Unit abstractions illustrate the frameworks' applicability. The proposed SoS conceptual framework represents the initial conceptual support for modeling, simulation, analysis, and dynamic architecting of heterogeneous SoS configurations. We plan to refine the component architecture meta-model, specify a language workbench with Domain-Specific Orchestration Language support, and verify the configuration-based simulation manifest creation. These actions lead to the framework's next stage, an operational framework (OF) instance, as a transitional artifact to the aimed software framework (SwF) counterpart.
Improving Digital Twin Experience Reports;PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL-DRIVEN ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (MODELSWARD);"Oakes, BJ; Parsai, A; Van Mierlo, S; Demeyer, S; Denil, J; De Meulenaere, P; Vangheluwe, H";;C;;Digital twins (DTs) are prevalent throughout industrial domains as evidenced by the rapid pace of experience reports in the literature. However, there remains disagreement about the precise definition of a DT and the essential characteristics in the DT paradigm, such as the scope of the system-under-study and the time-scale of its communication with the DT. These experience reports could therefore be hampering further classification and research insights by not reporting all of these relevant details about the DT solutions. We address these concerns by providing a conceptual structure for DTs as a common understanding and checklist for researchers and practitioners to precisely describe the characteristics and capabilities of their DT solutions. We express five experience reports using our structure to demonstrate its applicability and role as a guideline to improve the reporting of characteristics and increase the clarity of future experience reports.
UAV-Assisted Three-Dimensional Spectrum Mapping Driven by Spectrum Data and Channel Model;SYMMETRY-BASEL;"Du, XF; Zhu, QM; Ding, GR; Li, J; Wu, QH; Lan, TX; Lin, ZP; Zhong, WZ; Han, L";;J;;As the number of civil aerial vehicles increase explosively, spectrum scarcity and security become an increasingly challenge in both the airspace and terrestrial space. To address this difficulty, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the tensor completion method by about 12.5% and 92.3%, respectively, in terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.
Decentralized Autonomous Operations and Organizations in TransVerse: Federated Intelligence for Smart Mobility;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS;"Zhao, C; Dai, XY; Lv, YS; Niu, JL; Lin, YL";;J;;Human and social factors are essential to transportation systems, yet top-down management fails to consider them sufficiently. Consequently, management strategies are not tailored to human needs and are inadequate in providing transportation intelligence. This article investigates a management architecture based on decentralized/distributed autonomous operations/organizations (DAOs) that considers both the technical and societal aspects in our transportation metaverse, TransVerse. This design maps people's transportation needs in physical space to their digital counterparts in cyberspace, utilizing blockchain technology to guarantee the secure exchange of information and ultimately bring about the Internet of Minds (IoM). With the federated intelligence that emerged in IoM, we can devise reliable and prompt traffic decisions by incorporating consensus, community voting, and smart contracts into the organizational, coordination, and execution structure. Details on operational procedures and key technologies are also covered. To demonstrate the efficacy of DAOs-based management, a case study of world model-driven cooperative signal control is provided, indicating its promising application in future transportation management.
A virtual model knowledge updating method driven by data;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY;"Luo, RP; Sheng, BY; Fu, GC; Huang, YZ; Jian, YC; Chen, G";;J;;In the initial construction of unit-level virtual models in the discrete production system, the understanding of physical entities and the actual operating environment is lacking, and the virtual models need to be iteratively updated to resemble the physical entities more closely. To solve the above problems, an updating method for knowledge in the virtual model driven by data is studied. Firstly, the behavior model in the virtual model can be divided into basic functional models such as forward kinematics, trajectory planning, and material generation, and the knowledge components to support functional model computation are constructed. Secondly, the evaluation indexes for the quality, maintainability, and reliability of the knowledge components are established, and appropriate knowledge component combinations can be selected from the knowledge component base. Then, based on the measurements, it is used to the triggering judgment, and a knowledge component combination with the smallest difference between the simulation output of the virtual model and the real data of physical entities is selected from multiple combinations to realize the iterative update of the model. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method are verified by examples.
Data-Driven Methodology to Support Long-Lasting Logistics and Decision Making for Urban Last-Mile Operations;SUSTAINABILITY;"Gutierrez-Franco, E; Mejia-Argueta, C; Rabelo, L";;J;;Last-mile operations in forward and reverse logistics are responsible for a large part of the costs, emissions, and times in supply chains. These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data- and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage.
Digital Behavioral Twins for Safe Connected Cars;Proceedings of the 21th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems;Chen X,Kang E,Shiraishi S,Preciado VM,Jiang Z;2018.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Driving is a social activity which involves endless interactions with other agents on the road.

Vaimann; A. Kallaste";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Digital Twin (DT) technology has achieved a significant breakthrough in the development of numerous applications, including electric vehicles (EVs). This technique involves the creation of a virtual version of a real object, utilizing simulation and optimization tools with real data to optimize its functioning. The traction inverter is considered the brain of the EV drive system, as it controls the power flow between the battery and the electric motor. It converts the DC voltage from the battery into AC voltage and adjusts the frequency and amplitude to control the speed and torque of the motor. This research work presents the DT modelling procedures of an EV traction inverter.

Digital Twins for Sustainable Software Systems;2023 IEEE/ACM 7th International Workshop on Green And Sustainable Software (GREENS);"M. Heithoff; A. Hellwig; J. Michael; B. Rumpe";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Sustainable software systems aim to create resource-efficient software products and reduce the carbon impact of applications. Current approaches for sustainability assessment of software are either only focused on their operation or rely on methods in their engineering. More holistic approaches for sustainable software system spanning are missing. Thus, we are interested in the engineering of sustainable software systems together with the monitoring of their sustainability goals over their whole lifetime. Within this paper, we suggest using digital twins to accompany software systems in all life cycle phases with a specific focus on using model-driven engineering methods for the creation of applications. We can generate accompanying digital twins which share relevant models and data with the actual system and provide services for the assessment of sustainability indicators. In the long run, this provides us with better assessment options for software systems.
Concept of a Modular and System Model Driven Digital Twin for Engineering Education;2023 18th Annual System of Systems Engineering Conference (SoSe);"F. Wilking; M. Behringer; M. Fett; S. Goetz; E. Kirchner; S. Wartzack";2023.0;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;Driven by the opportunities for condition monitoring and new business models, Digital Twins have become a popular topic within research and industrial application over the last years. Therefore, universities must integrate the development of Digital Twins into their educational program to enable future engineers to overcome the challenges concomitant with Digital Twins. While a theoretical basis for Digital Twins is crucial e.g., hardware-software integration, Internet of Things (IoT) or simulation models, a practical combination of these heterogeneous components is also necessary to introduce the Digital Twin as a whole concept. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) an approach was introduced to grasp complexity by using system models e.g., through SysML diagrams. Digital Twins are an example for advanced systems shaped by high complexity. The usage of system models is therefore likely. With this contribution, a concept is presented to combine system models and Digital Twins to create a prototype for academic education and the conduction of student projects.

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.
A Community-Sourced View on Engineering Digital Twins: A Report from the EDT.Community;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Cleophas L,Godfrey T,Khelladi DE,Lehner D,Combemale B,van den Brand M,Vierhauser M,Wimmer M,Zschaler S;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Digital Twins are an important concept, enabling what-if scenario exploration, predictive maintenance, and other approaches. They help in saving time and physical resources when developing and evolving systems, whether natural or engineered. However, constructing and maintaining digital twins is a challenging engineering task - and, to date, there is a lack of understanding of the engineering techniques and methodologies required. To address these challenges, we created EDT.Community, a programme of seminars on the engineering of digital twins hosting digital twins experts from academia and industry. In this paper, we report on the main topics of discussion from the first year of the programme. We contribute by providing (1) a common understanding of open challenges in research and practice of the engineering of digital twins, and (2) an entry point to researchers who aim to close gaps in the current state of the art.
TwinOps - DevOps Meets Model-Based Engineering and Digital Twins for the Engineering of CPS;Proceedings of the 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Hugues J,Hristosov A,Hudak JJ,Yankel J;2020.0;Conference Paper;ACM;The engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) requires a large set of expertise to capture the system requirements and to derive a correct solution. Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS.In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems. We illustrate our contribution using a Digital Twins case study to illustrate TwinOps benefits, combining AADL and Modelica models, and an IoT platform.
Reliable Counterparts: Efficiently Testing Causal Relationships in Digital Twins;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Somers RJ,Clark AG,Walkinshaw N,Hierons RM;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;The lack of testability of digital twins poses several difficulties when developing reliable systems. Intricate models complicate the definition of comprehensive testing criteria, and physical couplings make obtaining test data an arduous task. To alleviate these challenges, we explore the use of causal inference based testing and propose a technique to allow for correct behaviour of digital twins to be captured in causal diagrams, which are then tested with an efficient data set through the use of counterfactuals. We explore a motivating example of a robotic arm to show how this technique can confirm known causal relationships in a system, and even uncover a fault in the system which caused dangerous behaviour. Our technique localised this erroneous behaviour to a single causal relationship between two variables. Having shown this technique works with a case study, we explore its limitations and the challenges when approaching other industrial applications.
Classification and Mapping of Layout Algorithms for Usage in Graph-like Modeling Languages;Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems: Companion Proceedings;Wrobel G,Scheffler R;2022.0;Conference Paper;ACM;Graph-lik>modeling languages (GLML) are important modeling artifacts for software tools that are used in the environment of software and systems engineering, digital twins, and domain-specific modeling. Just as with textual languages, the concrete syntax is the representation of the language elements intended for humans and thus has a decisive influence on the comprehensibility and usability of the language.The concrete syntax of GLML is often defined less precisely or in less detail when designing metamodels. While metamodels can be designed independently or even without concrete syntax, the latter is required for the actual usage of a graphical language. The layout and the interaction support for editing the language elements are commonly delegated to tool development. However, the development of modeling tools focuses on functionality such as model transformation and model execution, disregarding usability and handling. Low user acceptance then leads to niche applications and a limited number of users. The main reason for the lack of support for laying out and editing the language elements are complex integration challenges mainly concerning the development or adaptation of suitable layout procedures for GLML.Some frameworks offer a remedy by providing layout procedures for GLML. However, GLML differ from each other concerning their concrete syntax. Even minor differences in the concrete syntax of two languages can make the desirransferable or only transferable through complex adaptations. Formal methods for matching the concrete syntax of a GLML with existing layout procedures as early as during the development of the language are missing.In this paper, we present a classification scheme for layout procedures for GLML. The classification scheme is based on a classification scheme we developed for the concrete syntax of GLML, and it contains significant features. We define a mapping procedure between the two classifiers. As a result, the mapping decides whether a layout procedure can be used for a GLML. Both the classification scheme and the process of mapping are demonstrated in a real-world example of a technical graphical domain-specific modeling language.The presented approach supports the design of GLML and the tool development for GLML. It can be an important step towards automated tool development.
