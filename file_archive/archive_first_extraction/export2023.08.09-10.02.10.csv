Applying Model-Driven Engineering techniques to the creation and maintenance of Digital Twins (also referred to as Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering) promises automation and consistency throughout the life cycle of a Digital Twin. The exemplar provided in this paper can be used to identify open challenges when it comes to Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering, and to demonstrate how approaches can solve them. This exemplar applies Digital Twins to an indoor air quality management use case, where CO2, temperature, and humidity values of rooms within a building are measured. These values can be used to derive actions to improve work productivity and reduce the risk for virus infections. We describe three applications that make use of this Digital Twin (i.e., runtime visualization, physical simulation, and ML-based predictions), and provide an online repository with the artefacts of this exemplar.","","978-1-6654-2484-4","10.1109/MODELS-C53483.2021.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643702","","Temperature measurement;Productivity;Visualization;Runtime;Digital twin;Atmospheric modeling;Predictive models","air quality;buildings (structures);computer simulation;data visualisation;humidity;indoor environment;quality management;structural engineering computing","exemplar;Model-Driven Digital Twin Engineering;automation;indoor air quality management;humidity values;building;work productivity;virus infections;runtime visualization;physical simulation;ML-based predictions;online repository","","2","","22","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS’s behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models"" are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212109","Reference Architecture;Model-Driven Engineering;Digital Twin Engineering","Runtime environment;Digital twin;Space technology;Buildings;Data models;Real-time systems;Model driven engineering","business data processing;embedded systems;query processing;software architecture","system states;design-time models;model repository query;management engine;reference architecture;model repositories;digital twins;cyber-physical systems;digital representation;real-time data;model-driven engineering;MDE;physical components;logical models;design time;runtime environment;engineering tool;running system;design-time knowledge;CPS behaviour","","6","","16","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate these problems, we propose an approach for inferring simulation models of Digital Twins by machine learning. Instead of learning the simulation model of one specific simulator, we aim at learning their construction process. This generality enables reusing the inferred knowledge in different (but congruent) Digital Twin settings. To achieve this level of generality, we propose the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism for capturing simulation models; and reinforcement learning (RL) for inferring DEVS models.

A core component of a DT is the virtual entity (VE) that is meant to ‘mirror’ the physical entity (PE). A particular challenge for developing this VE is the integration between the different models that typically make up such a VE. These models, covering different disciplines or aspects of a system, commonly are developed by different engineers and expressed in different formalisms given their strengths and weaknesses. This makes integration between these models and formalisms a challenge. Such integration has two aspects: the communication among the models, and their orchestration, which concerns the order of model step execution and data exchange. In this paper, we consider the suitability of Ptolemy II, an open source framework based on an actor-oriented structure, to implement such integration. We use the Ptolemy II framework to reproduce the implementation of a DT of an autonomous scaled-down truck, which originally required a more manual configuration and execution and was developed in a monolithic way. The results show that Ptolemy II can be used to implement different communication technologies as actors, and show the expressiveness of the orchestrators by reproducing the existing DT’s behavior. This shows Ptolemy II in principle to be suitable as an integration and orchestration tool for models in the context of DTs. As future work, we plan to apply the framework to more complex DTs using different communication technologies, so as to validate its broader suitability for VE orchestration in DTs.","","978-1-6654-2484-4","10.1109/MODELS-C53483.2021.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643793","Ptolemy II;Digital twin;orchestration;integration;framework","Digital twin;Manuals;Data models;Communications technology;Model driven engineering;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Context modeling","electronic data interchange;object-oriented programming;production engineering computing;public domain software;specification languages;virtual reality","VE orchestration;virtual entity integration;digital twins;digital transformation;physical entity;model step execution;open source framework;Ptolemy II;communication technologies;orchestrators;orchestration tool;DT behavior;industry 4.0;data exchange;actor-oriented structure;autonomous scaled-down truck","","2","","7","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases. A case study shows the benefits of developing and maintaining DTs based on AutomationML models using the proposed AML4DT framework.

Commonly, a digital twin is defined based on a virtual entity (VE) that exhibits similar behavior to its physical counterpart, and that is coupled to this physical entity (PE). The VE thus forms a core part of any digital twin. While VEs may differ vastly—from ones based on simple simulation to high-fidelity virtual mirroring of the corresponding PE—they are typically composed of multiple models that may originate from multiple domains, address different aspects, and are expressed and processed using different tools and languages. Furthermore, the use of time series data—whether historical or real-time or both—from the PE distinguishes VEs from mere simulations. As a consequence of the modeling landscape complexity and the data aspect of VEs, the design of a digital twin and specifically of the VE as part of it represents several challenges. In this paper, we present our vision for the development, evolution, maintenance, and verification of such virtual entities for digital twins.","","978-1-6654-2484-4","10.1109/MODELS-C53483.2021.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643761","digital twin;model consistency;model orchestration;dynamic consistency;model management;digital twin development roadmap","Digital twin;Time series analysis;Maintenance engineering;Real-time systems;Model driven engineering;Data models;Complexity theory","augmented reality;program verification;software maintenance;software tools;time series;virtual reality languages","digital twin;virtual entity;DT;VE;physical entity;PE;time series data;software evolution;software maintenance;software development;software verification","","3","","20","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the “Papyrus for Manufacturing” toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning. This paper showcases this approach through a robotic cell use case.","2769-3899","979-8-3503-1125-9","10.1109/ICPS58381.2023.10128003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128003","Digital Twins;Industry 4.0;Asset Administration Shell;Semantic Interoperability;Ontology;Model-Based Engineering","Adaptation models;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Production;Ontologies;Cognition;Digital twins","cyber-physical systems;digital twins;knowledge representation;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;production engineering computing;software engineering","AAS modeling framework;AAS-based plant models;adaptable production lines;Asset Administration Shell;control system;current syntactic-only;digital representation;digital twin modeling tools;digital twin models;digital twins;expanded ontology;extreme flexibility;flexible production lines;interoperability gap;Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology;MaRCO instances;model-driven engineering tools;ontological elements;ontologies i.e;ontology-based approach;Ontology-based Capability checking;platform aligns modeling;production lines management;semantic descriptions;semantic interoperability;syntactic interoperability","","","","24","IEEE","24 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experts make decisions for multiple operational objectives such as minimizing cost, maximizing productivity, ensuring compliance to environmental conditions, etc. However, deciding strategies to achieve an objective can be highly non-trivial as it may lead to conflicting outcomes concerning other objectives. Modern digital twin(DT) technologies make it possible to build systems to support such decision-making to validate critical decisions. DTs are developed as one-off solutions for individual plants in the current practice, requiring high efforts and domain knowledge. Our work demonstrates the use of a knowledge-driven approach to reduce DT development efforts significantly. The main contribution of our work is an end-to-end architecture that allows us to explicate, structure, and reuse domain knowledge to semi-automate DT development for industrial plants. We integrate technologies like semantic web, model-driven engineering, and formal methods to realize the architecture.

Then, relying on a GP and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), two digital twin models of vehicles driving state are established, respectively, which set the transmission system and power system parameters as well as weather conditions as input parameters; and vehicle running speed and torque value as output ones. Both digital twin models consider the physical rule of the vehicle to avoid overfitting in the training. The analytical results indicate that the GP-based digital twin model appears more accurate in predicting the driving parameters of the vehicles, whereas the model based on the DCNN has better convergence precision within a short span of time.

This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature.

However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap! to create SDL4Snap!, an open-source and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes. Overall, the resulting tool has the potential to reduce the entry barrier to Digital Twins in small and medium enterprises, which are part of the late majority and laggard groups regarding the adoption of digital technologies in the context of Industry 4.0.","","978-1-6654-2484-4","10.1109/MODELS-C53483.2021.00120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643622","low code;Industry 4.0;interdisciplinary;SDL;Snap!;Simulation;Digital Twin","Visualization;Limiting;Service robots;Digital twin;Prototypes;Programming;Model driven engineering","Internet;production engineering computing;public domain software;source code (software);specification languages;virtual reality;visual languages;visual programming","low-code programming;SDL-based modeling;Industry 4.0;digital transformation process;visual block programming languages;specification languages;Digital Twin;abstraction level;open-source tool;Web-based tool;SDL4Snap!","","1","","56","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches.

In this paper, an application of the DT service unit for AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection is presented. According to real-time measurements, Linux Robot Operation System (ROS) simulates AC electrical machine-specific behavior in case of unbalanced stator currents and notify about possible fault appearance and propagation. Fault, such as discussed in the paper (AC machine stator inter-turn) is considered one of the most prevalent possible electrical motor failure.","","978-1-6654-1456-2","10.1109/IWED52055.2021.9376328","Estonian Research Council(grant numbers:PSG453); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9376328","Industry applications;Motor drives;Model-driven development","Machine learning algorithms;Fault detection;Signal processing algorithms;Stators;Electrical fault detection;Real-time systems;Integrated circuit reliability","AC motors;fault diagnosis;stators","AC motor stator inter-turn short circuit fault detection;industry digitalization;virtual twin;physical object operation;DT service unit;AC electrical machine-specific behavior;AC machine stator inter-turn;digital twin service unit;electrical motor failure","","6","","18","IEEE","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.","","978-1-6654-3495-9","10.1109/MODELS50736.2021.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592190","Models at Runtime;Digital Twins;Data Analysis;Intelligent Public Transportation Systems","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Runtime;Digital twin;Urban areas;Time series analysis;Tools","adaptive systems;directed graphs;public transport;time series","DataTime;adaptive systems;full-fledged digital twins;local states;predictive model;Intelligent Public Transportation Systems","","1","","18","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The manufacturing systems of tomorrow must offer a high degree of autonomy, be quickly re-planned to other operations, and cope with a wide variety of unforeseen situations, in a secure and safe manner.

We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results.","","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001369","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001103); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1806600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001369","Intelligent wireless communications;digital twin;performance prediction;channel state information (CSI);linear beamforming","Wireless communication;Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Precoding;Simulation;Predictive models;Iterative methods","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;optimisation;precoding;telecommunication computing","coarse model-driven approximations;CSI uncertainty;derivative method;dynamically changing environment;generic framework;generic learnable model-driven framework;imperfect MIMO system performance;imperfect multiple-input multiple-output systems;iterative manner;learned predictor;light neural network;model-based methods;network auto-tuning tasks;performance prediction;refined prediction;regularized zero-forcing precoding;transmit RZF precoding;uncertain channel state information;unknown interference;usage instance","","","","15","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an artificial neural network controller to control Double Differential Gas Turbine (DDGT) by use algorithm to synchronize the speed of two turbines at each variable turbine load to reduce low power balance in the system. From the Rowen's model of control for a turbine, the author analyzed and combined with the existing model to construct a dual turbine combinatorial structure coupled by differential coupling. Model-driven control algorithms are used as training grounds for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to replace traditional PID controllers. Because the double tubine construction is strong nonlinear system, modeling is directly transformed from the object model. Simulation results for a dual-turbine twin-turbine combination of 32MW, demonstrating the suitability of the theory.
