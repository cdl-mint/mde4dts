In manufacturing, digital twins can optimize production, prevent failures, and save resources. To consolidate the different approaches to digital twins in manufacturing, ISO 23247 defines the essential functional elements of a digital twin. We present a model-driven digital twin exemplar that realizes part of this standard to analyze milling processes. Our digital twin reference architecture includes a digital twin service component that manages and connects different services to adapt the manufacturing process according to a given objective. Two digital twin services, for the adaptation of component and tool conditions and for geometric error adaptation, illustrate the potential of this reference architecture. The digital twin connects to an industrial milling machine via domain-specific languages. This exemplar uses models at design time and at runtime to separate the concerns of software engineers and domain experts and leverages these models to understand and optimize the use of industrial machine tools.;;
Conference Paper;Jayaraman R,Lehner D,Klikovits S,Wimmer M;Towards Generating Model-Driven Speech Interfaces for Digital Twins;;2023;;;459-464;IEEE Press;V‰sterÂs, Sweden;2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C);;2023;;;"https://doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00080;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00080""""";;The recent decade saw enormous advances of the capabilities of speech synthesis and speech recognition. While specific benefits depend on the individual applications, speech interfaces typically increase accessibility, enable ‚Äúhands-free‚Äù and ‚Äúno-screen‚Äù interaction, and often increase interaction speed and allow for more flexible usage patterns and increased multitasking, leading to higher user satisfaction. This paper presents a method to transfer these powerful benefits to the digital twin (DT) domain by automatically generating speech interfaces for DT applications. Our approach is based on Model Driven Engineering principles, where we automatically deduce command patterns from structural model information as used in, e.g., DT platform specifications. The speech interface generation is highly configurable and extendable, thus it can be applied to different DT models. The concepts behind the generator are generic as well, thus they can be ported to other applications and platforms. We validate our approach by applying it to two DT demonstration cases and provide a detailed description of the sketch interface configuration workflow.;;

While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.;;

Engineering digital twin solutions is a knowledge and effort intensive activity. In-depth knowledge of manufacturing plant, process operations, underlying physics, data, and technical problems is essential in the design of digital twin application for a given business objective. Industry domain experts, data scientists and solution developers must collaborate to build it with the required features and functionalities. Currently, it is not an easily scalable process. For each industry vertical and even for the same plant type, the development process has to be repeated manually. To address this, we present a model-driven knowledge-based approach where knowledge can be captured in a machine processible form and reasoned with, to systematically guide the solution development process. Knowledge is modelled at three levels of abstraction, namely, meta, plant type and plant instance. We describe how this helps in generalizing the knowledge, in driving the knowledge acquisition process, and in contextualizing knowledge to specific problem instances. We then outline how the captured knowledge can be exploited to guide various digital twin engineering tasks such as problem definition, model building (physics or data-driven), data preparation, algorithm selection, etc. In particular, we discuss how the approach helps in arriving at a detailed digital twin specification starting from a high-level business problem statement. We present a case study demonstrating the approach on a real-life industrial problem.;;

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.;software architecture, model-driven software engineering, information systems, digital twins, cyber-physical systems;MODELS '20

They allow to connect various models with running systems based on bi-directional data exchange. Thus, design models can be extended with runtime views which also opens the door for many additional techniques such as identifying unexpected system changes during runtime. However, dedicated reactions to these unexpected changes, such as adapting an existing plan which has been computed in advance and may no longer be seen beneficial, are still often neglected in Digital Twins.To tackle this shortcoming, we propose so-called reactive planning that integrates Digital Twins with planning approaches to react to unforeseen changes during plan execution. In particular, we introduce an extended Digital Twin architecture which allows to integrate existing model-driven optimization frameworks. Based on this integration, we present different strategies how the replanning can be performed by utilizing the information and services available in Digital Twins. We evaluate our approach for a stack allocation case study. This evaluation yields promising results on how to effectively improve existing plans during runtime, but also allows to identify future lines of research in this area.;Optimization, Models@Runtime, Planning, Digital twin;

To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%.;Welding production line, Digital twin, Capacity evaluation, Scheduling optimization;

We propose model-driven software engineering to realize interactive digital twins and user-specific cockpits to interact with the digital twin by generating the infrastructure from common data structure models. To this end, we present a model-driven architecture for digital twins, its integration with an interactive cockpit, and a systematic method of realizing both. Through this, modeling, deploying, and monitoring interactive digital twins becomes more feasible and fosters their successful application in smart manufacturing.;Smart manufacturing, Model-driven software engineering, Information systems, Digital Twins;

Understanding the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) applications is a challenging task because they are not only inherently hard-to-trace distributed systems, but their integration with the environment via sensors adds another layer of complexity. Related work proposes to record data during the execution of the system, which can later be replayed to analyze the system. We apply the model-driven development approach to this idea and leverage digital twins to collect the required data. We enable developers to replay and analyze the system‚Äôs executions by applying model-to-model transformations. These transformations instrument component and connector (C&C) architecture models with components that reproduce the system‚Äôs environment based on the data recorded by the system‚Äôs digital twin. We validate and evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) case study.

With modelling gaining traction for analysis-heavy use cases like decision-making and regulatory compliance where domain experts play a central role, this barrier is beginning to hurt even more. We posit that Generative AI techniques can significantly lower this barrier by enabling domain experts to construct purposive models by operating at natural language level. This requires domain experts to interact with Generative AI tools using the right purpose-specific contextual prompts. We propose a model-driven approach where purposive meta models guide the interactions between domain expert and Generative AI to generate such prompts. The proposed approach helps in overcoming some of the limitations of Generative AI such as missing local context, limited context window size, attention fading etc. Industry scale models are typically large, necessitating a team of experts to work in a coordinated manner which requires sharing of outputs and persistence across sessions. Our approach brings together MDE and Generative AI in a symbiotic relationship complimenting respective strengths and overcoming limitations. We have validated this approach for development of digital twin based applications and early results are encouraging.;;

To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.;Digital Twin, Injection molding, Cyber-Physical Production System, Model-driven development, Reference architecture;

Digital Twins (DTs) provide comprehensive views on such systems, the data they generate during runtime, as well as their usage and evolution over time. Setting up the required infrastructure to run a Digital Twin is still an ambitious task that involves significant upfront efforts from domain experts, although existing knowledge about the systems, such as engineering models, may be already available for reuse. To address this issue, we present AML4DT, a model-driven framework supporting the development and maintenance of Digital Twin infrastructures by employing AutomationML (AML) models. We automatically establish a connection between systems and their DTs based on dedicated DT models. These DT models are automatically derived from existing AutomationML models, which are produced in the engineering phases of a system. Additionally, to alleviate the maintenance of the DTs, AML4DT facilitates the synchronization of the AutomationML models with the DT infrastructure for several evolution cases. A case study shows the benefits of developing and maintaining DTs based on AutomationML models using the proposed AML4DT framework. For this particular study, the effort of performing the required tasks could be reduced by about 50%.;;

We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling & Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss the rigor of our validation of the proposed approach and associated technology infrastructure through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.;simulatable model, digital twin, decision making, agent model;MODELS '22

Each production unit is designed and programmed for a specific task. Therefore, the reliability assessment is conducted once before the operation, mostly manually, and is based on traditional reliability models, such as event trees, fault trees, or reliability block diagrams. In comparison to traditional production systems, the focus of modern, complex production systems is shifted towards the software part. This is emphasized by the concepts of digital twins and Software-Defined Manufacturing (SDM). These software-intensive and safety-critical systems have more frequent software updates to address higher system flexibility and adjustable production processes. Therefore, SDM systems require a new approach to reliability assessment. Each software update can change the system behavior significantly. This leads to the necessity to reconduct the reliability assessment automatically before each software update. Advanced and hybrid reliability models are the key enabling technology. These models must be automatically generated and synchronized with the available system models and digital twins. Model-to-Model (M2M) transformation methods are another enabling technology.In this paper, we present a case study on automated and continuous reliability assessment of SDM. It shows, that our new method is a suitable candidate to enable the reliability assessment of SDM based on digital twins. The method includes (i) the extension of SysML v2 for reliability assessment, (ii) the automatic generation of hybrid reliability models from the digital twin, and (iii) their reliability assessment with new solvers developed for our OpenPRA framework.;software-defined manufacturing, reliability assessment, model-to-model (M2M) transformation, digital twin, case study, SysML v2;MODELS '22

Tools and approaches in civil engineering and architectural informatics produce artifacts that are geometrical or geographical representations describing physical spaces. The models we consider conform to the CityGML standard  although relying on international standards and accessible in machine-readable formats, such physical space descriptions often lack semantic information that can be used to support analyses. In our context, analysis as commonly understood in software engineering refers to reasoning on properties of an abstracted model‚Äîin this case a city design. We support model-based development, firstly by providing a way to derive analyzable models from CityGML descriptions, and secondly, we ensure that changes performed are propagated correctly. Essentially, a digital twin of a city is kept synchronized, in both directions, with the information from the actual city. Specifically, our formal programming technique and accompanying technical framework assure that relevant information added, or changes applied to the domain (resp. analyzable) model are reflected back in the analyzable (resp. domain) model automatically and coherently. The technique developed is rooted in the theory of bidirectional transformations, which guarantees that synchronization between models is consistent and well behaved. Produced models can bootstrap graph-theoretic, spatial or dynamic analyses. We demonstrate that bidirectional transformations can be achieved in practice on real city models.;Digital twins, CityGML, Model-driven engineering, Bidirectional model transformations;

Monitoring the execution of CPSs is crucial since CPSs directly influence their physical environment. Like the actual system, the monitoring application must be designed, developed, and tested. Mobile CPSs, in contrast to stationary CPSs, bring the additional requirement that instances can dynamically join, leave, or fail during execution time. This dynamic behavior must also be considered in the monitoring application. This paper presents CPSAML, a language and code generation framework for the model-driven development of mobile CPS systems, including a cockpit application for monitoring and interacting with such a system. The pipeline starts with the formulation of the system and the CPSs it contains at an abstract level by the system architect using a domain-specific modeling language. Next, this model is transformed into SysML 2 for further extension and richer specificity by system engineers on a more technical level. In the last step of the pipeline, the SysML 2 model is used to generate code for the CPS devices, a system-wide digital twin, and the cockpit application mentioned above. This cockpit enables the operator to configure and apply the monitoring and interaction with the system during runtime.

We explore a motivating example of a robotic arm to show how this technique can confirm known causal relationships in a system, and even uncover a fault in the system which caused dangerous behaviour. Our technique localised this erroneous behaviour to a single causal relationship between two variables.

Although the concept of Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) in the field of autonomous systems -such as satellites, has long been researched and developed, that is not the case for their ground systems. Both satellites and ground stations operate autonomously. The latter however, are not equipped with the advanced Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) capabilities one finds today on-board all orbiting spacecrafts. The aim of the study presented in this paper is the improvement of ground stations' operational diagnostics by providing the operators with ad-hock, Operations-Dedicated Models (ODMs). The latter serve as a basis for the construction of the system's Digital Twin (DT) models. These models allow the operators react more quickly and more precisely to alarms raised by the station. By helping the operators identify the malfunction and correct it in the quickest delays, they can avoid loosing the next satellite telemetry (TM) data, thus saving precious time and costs. This would increase both the availability and maintainability of the system. In a larger framework, ODMs are ideally concurrently built and connected with the engineering and safety models of the system, in a sort of virtual continuous improvement loop. While the utter purpose of ODMs is their usage as the system's DTs during operations, they also contribute to the stations' architecture and robustness continuous improvement, through increasing its fault detection and mitigation capabilities.;operational diagnosis, model-based operations (MBO), model-based diagnosis (MBD), ground systems operations, fault trees (FTs), digital twins (DTs), behaviour trees (BTs), MBSE, MBSA;MODELS '22

Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-target tracking scenes.;;

Multiple configurations can also be defined to support the deployment of a digital twin in different execution contexts. The relevance of this metamodel was evaluated by two case studies. The first consists in deploying the digital twin of a cobot in a simulation environment. The second applies the approach in a home automation environment. In both cases, our metamodel provides complete and precise descriptions of the deployment process and thus constitutes a viable first step towards a model-driven approach for digital twin deployment.;;

Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS.

However, there is still a need to fill the gap regarding semantic interoperability, in order to allow efficient interactions between Industry 4.0 components.

In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT.

An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software. The results of this approach are thereby evaluated by a real-world case study, which is applied according to the concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0).;;

Unfortunately, the analysis and preparation of brownfield systems for adaptation, as well as the creation of digital twins, are challenging and time-consuming tasks. This paper presents an approach to automatically create digital models of systems based on 3D CAD models. To this end, the CAD data, stored as a STEP file, is analyzed to extract relevant information for a subsequent graph analysis, which is used to identify components, their dependencies, and the resulting functional modules. Finally, the gained knowledge is transformed into feature models that can be used as a digital model for configuration selection to support automatic reconfiguration planning of brownfield manufacturing systems. The developed approach is evaluated based on an industrial use case of a soft gripper system.;;

This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of ""experiments""  which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow.

Just as with textual languages, the concrete syntax is the representation of the language elements intended for humans and thus has a decisive influence on the comprehensibility and usability of the language.The concrete syntax of GLML is often defined less precisely or in less detail when designing metamodels. While metamodels can be designed independently or even without concrete syntax, the latter is required for the actual usage of a graphical language. The layout and the interaction support for editing the language elements are commonly delegated to tool development. However, the development of modeling tools focuses on functionality such as model transformation and model execution, disregarding usability and handling. Low user acceptance then leads to niche applications and a limited number of users. The main reason for the lack of support for laying out and editing the language elements are complex integration challenges mainly concerning the development or adaptation of suitable layout procedures for GLML.Some frameworks offer a remedy by providing layout procedures for GLML. However, GLML differ from each other concerning their concrete syntax. Even minor differences in the concrete syntax of two languages can make the desirransferable or only transferable through complex adaptations. Formal methods for matching the concrete syntax of a GLML with existing layout procedures as early as during the development of the language are missing.In this paper, we present a classification scheme for layout procedures for GLML. The classification scheme is based on a classification scheme we developed for the concrete syntax of GLML, and it contains significant features. We define a mapping procedure between the two classifiers. As a result, the mapping decides whether a layout procedure can be used for a GLML. Both the classification scheme and the process of mapping are demonstrated in a real-world example of a technical graphical domain-specific modeling language.The presented approach supports the design of GLML and the tool development for GLML. It can be an important step towards automated tool development.;layout-algorithm reuse, graph-like modeling languages, designing and implementing modeling languages, concrete syntax of modeling languages;MODELS '22

To address the complexity of systems, it is necessary to ensure that knowledge is transferred properly between projects, teams, and engineers. To avoid specification omissions and misinterpretations to surface in projects, clear communication is needed during the system‚Äôs development. The introduction of SysML and systems modeling was intended to improve the communication of design intent among stakeholders and engineers. System models have multiple diagrams that are all interconnected and interrelated, such that they represent a consistent view of a system. To comprehend the structure and the behavior of a complex system, proper visualization of the SysML models is needed. There are mature commercial tools that offers support to SysML modeling, and forming the major platforms for developing the SysML models. However, the current SysML modeling tools use 2-dimensional views to visualize the models, which limits the comprehension of a complex system. To overcome this limitation, the SysML models have to integrate into a 3D virtual environment. In this paper, we present the first step towards this solution by introducing the architecture and the implementation of a conversion layer, that converts a SysML model to a 3D representation. To validate the conversion layer a prototype is presented, which converts a SysML model developed with IBM Rhapsody into a 3D representation in the Unity Game Engine. The performed test showed that the complexity of the models can be comprehended more efficiently in 3D than in a 2D environment. Moreover, visualizing the SysML models in 3D offers a better understanding and insight into the structure and the behavior of a system. Coupling the 3D representation of the SysML models with the 3D CAD representation of the modeled system, as in the Digital Twin case, offers new ways of capturing the design of a complex system.;model validation, model execution, model conversion, Virtual Environment, SysML, Model‚ÄìDriven System Engineering, Digital Twin, 3D modeling;FAMECSE '22

CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability.

Failing to locate these agents and predict their possible future actions may result in serious safety hazards. Traditionally, the responsibility for avoiding these safety hazards is solely on the drivers. With improved sensor quantity and quality, modern ADAS systems are able to accurately perceive the location and speed of other nearby vehicles and warn the driver about potential safety hazards. However, accurately predicting the behavior of a driver remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a framework in which behavioral models of drivers (Digital Behavioral Twins) are shared among connected cars to predict potential future actions of neighboring vehicles, therefore improving the safety of driving. We provide mathematical formulations of models of driver behavior and the environment, and discuss challenging problems during model construction and risk analysis.

It is shown in the paper that, in cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management, the ontology-customized multi-agent engine and ontology-based model of enterprise are forming ontology-driven ‚ÄúDigital Twin‚Äù of the enterprise providing opportunity to combine operational scheduling of resources with ongoing real-time simulations and evolutional re-design of configuration of enterprise resources. The functionality and architecture of the autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are developed to support for the full cycle of autonomous decision making on resource management. Time metrics for measuring event-based response time and level of adaptability of autonomous cyber-physical multi-agent systems for adaptive resource management are proposed. Results of developments can be applied for smart transport and smart manufacturing, smart agriculture, smart logistics, smart supply chains, etc.;Performance metrics, Cyber-physical multi-agent systems, Model-driven, Autonomous systems, Resource management;

This creates new demands on enterprises to meet stated goals in a dynamic and uncertain environment that translate to demands on the enterprise‚Äôs software systems. Software systems however are currently designed to deliver a fixed set of goals and assumed to operate in a static environment, falling short in addressing the need for continuous adaptation under uncertainty. State-of-the-art adaptation architectures like MAPE-K have been applied to meeting non-functional requirements in a dynamic environment using a static repository of knowledge. This paper articulates the need for architecting software systems that learn from their own operation to dynamically extend existing knowledge, and utilize the knowledge to meet stated functional goals in an uncertain environment.;adaptation architecture, digital twin, knowledge modeling, learning, model driven engineering, run time models, software adaptation, software engineering, uncertainty;ISEC '22

Model-driven engineering (MDE) methods have been proven to be effective in increasing the productivity of CPS design. However, there is still a lack of MDE approaches that enable design space exploration as well as the code generation for the design of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based CPSs. To mitigate the situation, this article presents a unified modeling language named AIoTML for AIoT-based CPSs, which enables the construction of AI-based components across different modeling levels for the purposes of intelligent sensing and control. By extending the constructs of state-of-the-art domain-specific language (DSL) ThingML, AIoTML can seamlessly unify the modeling of both autonomous executions of AIoT devices and their surrounding physical environment, which facilitates both platform-independent simulation and control optimization for platform-specific CPSs. The compiler developed for AIoTML provides a family of code generators to support the construction of digital twins on various heterogeneous target AIoT platforms. Comprehensive evaluations on two complex real-world designs demonstrate the effectiveness of our AIoTML approach in the fast development of AIoT-based CPSs with high control quality.;;

The speed with which manufacturers, in particular SMEs, can reconfigure the production to a new run and thus respond to clients and avoid costly machine downtime is critical to maintaining commercial success and profit margins. The manufacturing systems of tomorrow must offer a high degree of autonomy, be quickly re-planned to other operations, and cope with a wide variety of unforeseen situations, in a secure and safe manner. In this context, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) is an emergent standard that leverages the digital twin approach and provides concepts for describing capabilities and skills of I4.0 components in order to automate the reconfiguration process. This article proposes a capability-based operation and engineering approach to tackle the syntactic and semantic interoperability problems in flexible production lines. We demonstrate the implementation of the AAS standard in the open source model-driven workbench Papyrus  then we assess its usability for modeling a production cell use case in order to implement a capability-based reconfiguration approach for flexible production lines.;;
Ph.D. Thesis;Keskin B,Cliff Davidson,Shobha Bhatia,Gurdip Singh,Ozan Koseoglu,Riyad Aboutaha;A Building Information Modeling (BIM)-Centric Digital Ecosystem for Smart Airport Life Cycle Management;;2021;;;;Syracuse University;USA;;;2021;;;;;"An increasing number of new airport infrastructure construction and improvement projects are being delivered in today's modern world. However, value creation is a recurring issue due to inefficiencies in managing capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), while trying to optimize project constraints of scope, time, cost, quality, and resources. In this new era of smart infrastructure, digitalization transforms the way projects are planned and delivered. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a key digital process technique that has become an imperative for today's Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector. This research suggests a BIM-centric digital ecosystem by detailing technical and strategic aspects of Airport BIM implementation and digital technology integration from a life cycle perspective. This research provides a novel approach for consistent and continuous use of digital information between business and functional levels of an airport by developing a digital platform solution that will enable seamless flow of information across functions. Accordingly, this study targets to achieve three objectives: 1- To provide a scalable know-how of BIM-enabled digital transformation; 2- To guide airport owners and major stakeholders towards converging information siloes for airport life cycle data management by an Airport BIM Framework; 3- To develop a BIM-based digital platform architecture towards realization of an airport digital twin for airport infrastructure life cycle management. Airport infrastructures can be considered as a System of Systems (SoS). As such, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is selected as the key methodology towards designing a digital ecosystem. Applying MBSE principles leads to forming an integrating framework for managing the digital ecosystem. Furthermore, this research adopts convergent parallel mixed methods to collect and analyze multiple forms of data. Data collection tools include extensive literature and industry review; an online questionnaire; semi-structured interviews with airport owner parties; focus group discussions; first-hand observations; and document reviews. Data analysis stage includes multiple explanatory case study analyses, thematic analysis, project mapping, percent coverage analysis for coded themes to achieve Objective 1; thematic analysis, cluster analysis, framework analysis, and non-parametric statistical analysis for Objective 2; and qualitative content analysis, non-parametric statistical analysis to accomplish Objective 3. This research presents a novel roadmap toward facilitation of smart airports with alignment and integration of disruptive technologies with business and operational aspects of airports. Multiple comprehensive case study analyses on international large-hub airports and triangulation of organization-level and project-level results systematically generate scalable technical and strategic guidelines for BIM implementation. The proposed platform architecture will incentivize major stakeholders for value-creation, data sharing, and control throughout a project life cycle. Introducing scalability and minimizing complexity for end-users through a digital platform approach will lead to a more connected environment. Consequently, a digital ecosystem enables sophisticated interaction between people, places, and assets. Model-driven approach provides an effective strategy for enhanced decision-making that helps optimization of project resources and allows fast adaptation to emerging business and operational demands. Accordingly, airport sustainability measures -economic vitality, operational efficiency, natural resources, and social responsibility- will improve due to higher levels of efficiency in CapEx and OpEx. Changes in business models for large capital investments and introducing sustainability to supply chains are among the anticipated broader impacts of this study.";;
