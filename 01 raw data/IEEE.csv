In manufacturing, digital twins can optimize production, prevent failures, and save resources. To consolidate the different approaches to digital twins in manufacturing, ISO 23247 defines the essential functional elements of a digital twin. We present a model-driven digital twin exemplar that realizes part of this standard to analyze milling processes. Our digital twin reference architecture includes a digital twin service component that manages and connects different services to adapt the manufacturing process according to a given objective. Two digital twin services, for the adaptation of component and tool conditions and for geometric error adaptation, illustrate the potential of this reference architecture. The digital twin connects to an industrial milling machine via domain-specific languages. This exemplar uses models at design time and at runtime to separate the concerns of software engineers and domain experts and leverages these models to understand and optimize the use of industrial machine tools.","","979-8-3503-2498-3","10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00081","Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350824","Digital Twin;Model-Driven Development;Software Architecture;Process Adaptation","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Manufacturing processes;Runtime;Software;Digital twins;Manufacturing","","2","","22","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.","","979-8-3503-2498-3","10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350749","Digital Twin;Model-Driven Engineering;Model Transformation;Digital Twin Platform","Industries;Computer architecture;Model driven engineering;Digital twins;Complexity theory;Software tools","","","","70","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Engineering digital twin solutions is a knowledge and effort intensive activity. In-depth knowledge of manufacturing plant, process operations, underlying physics, data, and technical problems is essential in the design of digital twin application for a given business objective. Industry domain experts, data scientists and solution developers must collaborate to build it with the required features and functionalities. Currently, it is not an easily scalable process. For each industry vertical and even for the same plant type, the development process has to be repeated manually. To address this, we present a model-driven knowledge-based approach where knowledge can be captured in a machine processible form and reasoned with, to systematically guide the solution development process. Knowledge is modelled at three levels of abstraction, namely, meta, plant type and plant instance. We describe how this helps in generalizing the knowledge, in driving the knowledge acquisition process, and in contextualizing knowledge to specific problem instances. We then outline how the captured knowledge can be exploited to guide various digital twin engineering tasks such as problem definition, model building (physics or data-driven), data preparation, algorithm selection, etc. In particular, we discuss how the approach helps in arriving at a detailed digital twin specification starting from a high-level business problem statement.

While specific benefits depend on the individual applications, speech interfaces typically increase accessibility, enable “hands-free” and “no-screen” interaction, and often increase interaction speed and allow for more flexible usage patterns and increased multitasking, leading to higher user satisfaction. This paper presents a method to transfer these powerful benefits to the digital twin (DT) domain by automatically generating speech interfaces for DT applications. Our approach is based on Model Driven Engineering principles, where we automatically deduce command patterns from structural model information as used in, e.g., DT platform specifications. The speech interface generation is highly configurable and extendable, thus it can be applied to different DT models. The concepts behind the generator are generic as well, thus they can be ported to other applications and platforms. We validate our approach by applying it to two DT demonstration cases and provide a detailed description of the sketch interface configuration workflow.","","979-8-3503-2498-3","10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350472","speech recognition;speech interfaces;model-driven engineering;interface generation;digital twin interface","Unified modeling language;Speech recognition;Multitasking;Model driven engineering;Generators;Digital twins;Speech synthesis","","","","24","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Commonly, a digital twin is defined based on a virtual entity (VE) that exhibits similar behavior to its physical counterpart, and that is coupled to this physical entity (PE). The VE thus forms a core part of any digital twin. While VEs may differ vastly—from ones based on simple simulation to high-fidelity virtual mirroring of the corresponding PE—they are typically composed of multiple models that may originate from multiple domains, address different aspects, and are expressed and processed using different tools and languages. Furthermore, the use of time series data—whether historical or real-time or both—from the PE distinguishes VEs from mere simulations. As a consequence of the modeling landscape complexity and the data aspect of VEs, the design of a digital twin and specifically of the VE as part of it represents several challenges.

A core component of a DT is the virtual entity (VE) that is meant to ‘mirror’ the physical entity (PE). A particular challenge for developing this VE is the integration between the different models that typically make up such a VE. These models, covering different disciplines or aspects of a system, commonly are developed by different engineers and expressed in different formalisms given their strengths and weaknesses. This makes integration between these models and formalisms a challenge. Such integration has two aspects: the communication among the models, and their orchestration, which concerns the order of model step execution and data exchange. In this paper, we consider the suitability of Ptolemy II, an open source framework based on an actor-oriented structure, to implement such integration. We use the Ptolemy II framework to reproduce the implementation of a DT of an autonomous scaled-down truck, which originally required a more manual configuration and execution and was developed in a monolithic way. The results show that Ptolemy II can be used to implement different communication technologies as actors, and show the expressiveness of the orchestrators by reproducing the existing DT’s behavior. This shows Ptolemy II in principle to be suitable as an integration and orchestration tool for models in the context of DTs. As future work, we plan to apply the framework to more complex DTs using different communication technologies, so as to validate its broader suitability for VE orchestration in DTs.","","978-1-6654-2484-4","10.1109/MODELS-C53483.2021.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643793","Ptolemy II;Digital twin;orchestration;integration;framework","Digital twin;Manuals;Data models;Communications technology;Model driven engineering;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Context modeling","","5","","7","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One way to deal with this increasing complexity is to create a digital representation of such systems, a so-called Digital Twin (DT), which virtually acts in parallel ideally across the entire life-cycle of a CPS. For this purpose, the DT uses simulated or real-time data to mimic operations, control, and may modify the CPS’s behaviour at runtime. However, building such DTs from scratch is not trivial, mainly due to the integration needed to deal with heterogeneous systems residing in different technological spaces. In order to tackle this challenge, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) allows to logically model a CPS with its physical components. Usually, in MDE such ""logical models"" are created at design time which keep them detached from the deployed system during runtime. Instead of building bilateral solutions between each runtime environment and every engineering tool, a dedicated integration layer is needed which can deal with both, design and runtime aspects. Therefore, we present a reference architecture that allows on the one side to query data from model repositories to enrich the running system with design-time knowledge, and on the other side, to be able to reasoning about system states at runtime in design-time models. We introduce a model repository query and management engine as mediator and show its feasibility by a demonstration case.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9212109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212109","Reference Architecture;Model-Driven Engineering;Digital Twin Engineering","Runtime environment;Digital twin;Space technology;Buildings;Data models;Real-time systems;Model driven engineering","","7","","16","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We posit that Generative AI techniques can significantly lower this barrier by enabling domain experts to construct purposive models by operating at natural language level. This requires domain experts to interact with Generative AI tools using the right purpose-specific contextual prompts. We propose a model-driven approach where purposive meta models guide the interactions between domain expert and Generative AI to generate such prompts. The proposed approach helps in overcoming some of the limitations of Generative AI such as missing local context, limited context window size, attention fading etc. Industry scale models are typically large, necessitating a team of experts to work in a coordinated manner which requires sharing of outputs and persistence across sessions. Our approach brings together MDE and Generative AI in a symbiotic relationship complimenting respective strengths and overcoming limitations.

This paper summarizes the evolution and development of process model and proposes twin process model, which could support the machining quality optimization of complex parts.

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting.

We specifically investigate the application of the proposed framework to a simple case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. The Bayesian model trained at the DT has the key advantage of capturing epistemic uncertainty regarding the communication system, e.g., regarding current traffic conditions, which arise from limited PT-to-DT data transfer.

Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the “Papyrus for Manufacturing” toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning.

To overcome this challenge, over the past years, various Industry 4.0 automation and robotics providers have presented solutions based on visual block programming languages, which follow an emerging low-code approach to reduce the entry barriers of digital technologies. However, block-based low-code tools typically lack the formality introduced by specification languages, limiting their ability to model the industrial processes formally. Taking this into account, in this article, we present the combination of specification languages and visual block programming languages to enable industrial users to test and/or build their own Digital Twin models at a suitable abstraction level and with low entry barriers. In particular, we combine SDL and Snap! to create SDL4Snap!, an open-source and web-based tool that facilitates the implementation and validation of Digital Twin prototypes.

Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (ie. values of properties of interest). DataTime provides a unifying interface to query the past, present and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system's sensors, and iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can deprecate the use of heterogeneous tools for managing data from the past, the present and the future, and facilitate the development of digital twins.","","978-1-6654-3495-9","10.1109/MODELS50736.2021.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592190","Models at Runtime;Digital Twins;Data Analysis;Intelligent Public Transportation Systems","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Runtime;Digital twin;Urban areas;Time series analysis;Tools","","2","","18","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, this requires analyzing, preparing for adaptation, and adapting brownfield manufacturing systems. The digital twin, a digital representation of a manufacturing system, is a key enabler for efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability. Unfortunately, the analysis and preparation of brownfield systems for adaptation, as well as the creation of digital twins, are challenging and time-consuming tasks. This paper presents an approach to automatically create digital models of systems based on 3D CAD models. To this end, the CAD data, stored as a STEP file, is analyzed to extract relevant information for a subsequent graph analysis, which is used to identify components, their dependencies, and the resulting functional modules. Finally, the gained knowledge is transformed into feature models that can be used as a digital model for configuration selection to support automatic reconfiguration planning of brownfield manufacturing systems. The developed approach is evaluated based on an industrial use case of a soft gripper system.","","979-8-3503-2498-3","10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350592","CAD data;Reconfiguration;Graph Analysis;Adaptation;Reengineering;Digital Twin;Digital Model","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Digital twins;Planning","","","","38","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software.

Since there is no practical way to instantaneously measure it at run time, a model is required for its estimation. Recently, several data-driven SOH models have been proposed, whose accuracy heavily relies on the quality of the datasets used for their training. Since these datasets are obtained from measurements, they are limited in the variety of the charge/discharge profiles. To address this scarcity issue, we propose generating datasets by simulating a traditional battery model (e.g., a circuit-equivalent one). The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to use a simulatable battery model to evaluate a potentially infinite number of workload profiles for training the data-driven model. Furthermore, this general concept can be applied using any simulatable battery model, providing a fine spectrum of accuracy/complexity tradeoffs. Our results indicate that using simulated data achieves reasonable accuracy in SOH estimation, with a 7.2 % error relative to the simulated model, in exchange for a 27X memory reduction and a $\approx 2000\mathrm{X}$ speedup.","","979-8-3503-1175-4","10.1109/ISLPED58423.2023.10244587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10244587","Battery modeling;digital twin;automotive","Training;Estimation;Battery charge measurement;Time measurement;Data models;Batteries;Digital twins","","","","22","IEEE","19 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-target tracking scenes.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2023.3310109","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62061003,61971149); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011657); Liuzhou Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:2021ADB0102); Guangxi Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022GXNSFBA035642); Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, China(grant numbers:2020B1212030002); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission, China; Basic Ability Enhancement Program for Young and Middle-Aged Teachers of Guangxi(grant numbers:2022KY0325); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10234393","Maneuvering-target tracking;digital twins;neural network","Target tracking;Data models;Noise measurement;Digital twins;Trajectory;Estimation;Feature extraction","","","","23","IEEE","30 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach is presented at two levels: first, a DT is modeled as a composition of basic components that provide basic functionalities, such as identification, storage, communication, security, data management, human-machine interface (HMI), and simulation; second, an aggregated DT is defined as a hierarchical composition of other DTs. A generic reference architecture based on these concepts and a concrete implementation methodology are proposed using AutomationML. This methodology follows an MDE approach that supports most of the DT features currently proposed in the literature. A case study has been developed, the proposed ideas are being evaluated with industrial case studies, and some of the preliminary results are described in this article. With the case study, it is possible to verify that the proposed methodology supports the creation and the deployment process of a DT.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2020.3032444","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior(grant numbers:10.13039/501100002322); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247401","AutomationML;cyber–physical systems (CPSs);digital twin (DT);Industry 4.0 (I4.0)","Data models;Computer architecture;Unified modeling language;Digital twin;Solid modeling;Industries;Context modeling;Cyber-physical systems;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","96","","49","IEEE","3 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Model-driven engineering (MDE) methods have been proven to be effective in increasing the productivity of CPS design. However, there is still a lack of MDE approaches that enable design space exploration as well as the code generation for the design of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based CPSs. To mitigate the situation, this article presents a unified modeling language named AIoTML for AIoT-based CPSs, which enables the construction of AI-based components across different modeling levels for the purposes of intelligent sensing and control. By extending the constructs of state-of-the-art domain-specific language (DSL) ThingML, AIoTML can seamlessly unify the modeling of both autonomous executions of AIoT devices and their surrounding physical environment, which facilitates both platform-independent simulation and control optimization for platform-specific CPSs. The compiler developed for AIoTML provides a family of code generators to support the construction of digital twins on various heterogeneous target AIoT platforms. Comprehensive evaluations on two complex real-world designs demonstrate the effectiveness of our AIoTML approach in the fast development of AIoT-based CPSs with high control quality.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3264786","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272170); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB2101300); Shanghai Trusted Industry Internet Software Collaborative Innovation Center; “Digital Silk Road” Shanghai International Joint Lab of Trustworthy Intelligent Software(grant numbers:22510750100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098154","Artificial intelligence Internet of Things (AIoT);cyber-physical systems (CPSs);domain-specific language (DSL);model-driven engineering (MDE);ThingML","Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence;Codes;DSL;Cloud computing;Digital twins;Behavioral sciences","","7","","45","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized.

The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks.
