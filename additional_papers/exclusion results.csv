12;Digital Twins for Sustainable Software Systems;Opinion Paper;Opinion Paper;"Philosophical, Opinion, or Experience paper (ehem. Challenges Paper) ""a digital twin of a system consists
of a set of models of the system and a set of digital shadows,
both of which are purposefully updated on a regular basis,
and provides a set of services to use both purposefully with
respect to the original system. The digital twin interacts with
the original system by providing useful information about the
systemÂ’s context and sending it control commands."""
