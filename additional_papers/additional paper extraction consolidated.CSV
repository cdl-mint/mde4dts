Concept of a Modular and System Model Driven Digital Twin for Engineering Education;;Merged;"It is generally defined as a concept in which operational data 
from a physical counterpart is processed within models to give 
recommendations towards a user or the system itself. Other 
components include its bidirectional orientation [9] as well as its 
real time capabilities [15].";SysML (BDD, Sequence Diagram, Parametric Diagram, State Machines);data model;Model to Model Transformation;;SysML;Simulink Model;"""MBSE seems a promising approach to grasp the increasing complexity of modern systems"", ""Hence, a model driven concept, 
which directly utilizes these models seems to be a promising 
approach e.g., by directly deriving executable code for the Twin. """;"""Digital Twins must be utilized to solve problems
