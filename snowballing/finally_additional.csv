0;A Framework for Service-Oriented Digital Twin Systems for Discrete Workshops and Its Practical Case Study;To address issues in discrete manufacturing workshops, such as the difficulty for management personnel to coordinate workshop production and the challenge of visualizing and supervising a massive amount of temporary data, this paper proposes a service-oriented digital-twin-system framework for discrete workshops using the industrial IoT platform as the system-service platform to solve the problems of the opaque monitoring of operators in discrete workshops, the low interactivity of 2D monitoring systems, and the difficulty of the visual monitoring of workshop data. Firstly, the current situation of intelligent manufacturing workshop-monitoring demand in the context of new-generation information technology is analyzed, and a six-dimensional digital-twin-workshop-monitoring architecture is proposed, whereby a discrete workshop monitoring system based on the digital twin is constructed with IoT as the service platform. We will conduct research on the construction of virtual workshops for the system development process, twin data collection based on edge computing gateways, and dynamic monitoring of the production process. Finally, through the application of this system framework in a movable-arm-production workshop, the more intelligent human–machine interaction process of browsing and controlling workshop information, such as the equipment layout and production processes in the virtual workshop, has been realized. This includes data acquisition based on edge-computing gateways, dynamic real-time monitoring of the production process, etc., which provides a reference for realizing the visual monitoring of the discrete workshop.;MDPI;Journal;Systems;2023-03-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151130222
1;Towards a Digital Twin Modelling Notation;Digital Twins (DTs) constitute a growing and promising trend recognised by academia and industry. They are virtual replicas of distinctive objects, processes, buildings, or humans. DTs are used to reason about their physical counterparts' functionalities, interactions, behaviours, and overall to plan optimal actions that they can perform or be subjected to. Given their intrinsic complexity, no standard definition nor a unified solution is yet available for designing and developing DTs. Intending to shed light on such a complex topic, we analysed the literature and derived a list of twelve pivotal characteristics of DTs. Such characteristics will be used as requirements for defining a Digital Twin Modelling Notation that will enable reasoning about the design of DT solutions.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings of the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, International Conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing, International Conference on Cyber Science and Technology Congress, DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech 2022;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145346103
2;Leveraging RDF Graphs, Similarity Metrics and Network Analysis for Business Process Management;The paper reports on an early iteration of a Design Science effort for defining a business process analytics method. The method hybridizes explicitly engineered knowledge and implicit knowledge, as it streamlines the following ingredients: BPMN modeling, semantic linking and the transformation of models into RDF graphs, natural language processing and network analysis applied on the resulting graph repository. The engineered knowledge comes in the form of a BPMN implementation that can transform diagrams into RDF, whereas the implicit knowledge is derived from analytic measures (similarity metrics, network analysis) that further annotate the graphs obtained from models, enabling richer semantic queries and filtering possibilities for Business Process Management use cases. The originating problem context consists of contract management and project management scenarios from which use cases will be exemplified. The proposed method is deployable as an orchestration of tools: the BEE-UP modeling environment, GraphDB for storage and Python libraries (rdflib, nltk, networkx) for processing the graphs and running the annotating analytics.;CEUR-WS;Conference Proceeding;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166471935
3;Multi-level approach to virtual commissioning: a reconfigurable assembly system case;Software plays a key role in modern automated systems. Testing the control software is one of the final steps in the development process and when done on the physical set up, it creates risks (e.g. project delay, system damage and operator injury). In addition, with flexible systems it is almost impossible to test every possible scenario on the real system. Using a digital model allows testing different configurations before the physical hardware is available and thus without risk for the operator and the system hardware. A digital model of the reconfigurable system can also help validate new configurations virtually while the real system still operates in its current configuration, allowing for a quick risk-less changeover. Depending on the level in the control hierarchy, the simulations can run faster than real time. This paper demonstrates the use of a digital model during the commissioning at different levels. On each level, other requirements need to be fulfilled and a different level of detail is needed in the model. Every level asks for a different set of input data, that needs to be consistent to result in a reliable emulation/simulation. The methodology is evaluated on a reconfigurable assembly system, consisting of multiple base units with modular, relocatable add-on modules. The most detailed level is the process and machine level, considering the low-level control logic, movements of the machine and robots, collisions, etc. Cell and plant level commissioning focuses on the interaction of multiple machines, transport, production schedule and assignment of tasks to the individual machines. This level typically covers a longer time span and requires less detail of the actions on the machine level. It interacts with higher level control software and a simplified version of the low-level control logic is implemented in the model itself. This paper describes the methodology and lessons learned to reuse the digital model at different levels of the control hierarchy while remaining the consistency by exchange of information within the digital model and with the real system. Further research is described towards automated virtual test case scenarios with a digital model for a reconfigurable assembly system.;Elsevier B.V.;Conference Proceeding;IFAC-PapersOnLine;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144532499
4;A Cross-Domain Systematic Mapping Study on Software Engineering for Digital Twins;Digital Twins are currently investigated as the technological backbone for providing an enhanced understanding and management of existing systems as well as for designing new systems in various domains, e.g., ranging from single manufacturing components such as sensors to large-scale systems such as smart cities. Given the diverse application domains of Digital Twins, it is not surprising that the characterization of the term Digital Twin, as well as the needs for developing and operating Digital Twins are multi-faceted. Providing a better understanding what the commonalities and differences of Digital Twins in different contexts are, may allow to build reusable support for developing, running, and managing Digital Twins by providing dedicated concepts, techniques, and tool support. In this paper, we aim to uncover the nature of Digital Twins based on a systematic mapping study which is not limited to a particular application domain or technological space. We systematically retrieved a set of 1471 unique publications of which 356 were selected for further investigation. In particular, we analyzed the types of research and contributions made for Digital Twins, the expected properties Digital Twins have to fulfill, how Digital Twins are realized and operated, as well as how Digital Twins are finally evaluated. Based on this analysis, we also contribute a novel feature model for Digital Twins from a software engineering perspective as well as several observations to further guide future software engineering research in this area.;Elsevier Inc.;Journal;Journal of Systems and Software;2022-11-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135797712
5;Generating customized low-code development platforms for digital twins;A digital twin improves our use of a cyber–physical system and understanding of its emerging behavior. To this effect, a digital twin is to be developed and configured and potentially also operated by domain experts, who rarely have a professional software engineering background and for whom easy access and support, e.g., in form of low-code platforms are missing. In this paper, we report on an integrated method for the model-driven engineering of low-code development platforms for digital twins that enables domain experts to create and operate digital twins for cyber–physical systems using the most appropriate modeling languages. The foundation of this method is (1) a code generation infrastructure for information systems combined with (2) an extensible base architecture for self-adaptive digital twins and (3) reusable language components for their configuration. Using this method, software engineers first configure the information system with the required modeling languages to generate the low-code development platform for digital twins before domain experts leverage the generated platform to create digital twins. This two-step method facilitates creating tailored low-code development platforms as well as creating and operating customized digital twins for a variety of applications.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Journal of Computer Languages;2022-06-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129984615
6;Integration Challenges for Digital Twin Systems-of-Systems;Research and industry leverage digital twins to monitor and control (cyber-physical) systems in various domains. For their efficient engineering, these twins need to become Systems-of-Systems (SoS), in which digital twins of smaller systems (e.g., a production machine) become parts of digital twins of larger systems (e.g., a factory). Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS. These insights may guide future research on engineering digital twins as well as practitioners considering the challenges in building and composing digital twin systems-of-systems.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings - 10th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering for Systems-of-Systems and Software Ecosystems, SESoS 2022;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135174156
7;Towards Development Platforms for Digital Twins: A Model-Driven Low-Code Approach;Digital Twins in smart manufacturing must be highly adaptable for different challenges, environments, and system states. In practice, there is a need for enabling the configuration of Digital Twins by domain experts. Low-code approaches seem to be a meaningful solution for configuration purposes but often lack extension options. We propose a model-driven low-code approach for the configuration and reconfiguration of Digital Twins using language plugins. This approach uses model-driven software engineering and software language engineering methods to derive a configurable digital twin implementation. Moreover, we discuss some remaining challenges such as interoperability, language modularity, evolution, integration of assistive services, collaborative development, and web-based debugging.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Book Series;IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology;2021-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85115225554
8;Digital Twin: Enabling Technologies, Challenges and Open Research;Digital Twin technology is an emerging concept that has become the centre of attention for industry and, in more recent years, academia. The advancements in industry 4.0 concepts have facilitated its growth, particularly in the manufacturing industry. The Digital Twin is defined extensively but is best described as the effortless integration of data between a physical and virtual machine in either direction. The challenges, applications, and enabling technologies for Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Twins are presented. A review of publications relating to Digital Twins is performed, producing a categorical review of recent papers. The review has categorised them by research areas: manufacturing, healthcare and smart cities, discussing a range of papers that reflect these areas and the current state of research. The paper provides an assessment of the enabling technologies, challenges and open research for Digital Twins.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Access;2020-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087331367
9;Mobility Digital Twin: Concept, Architecture, Case Study, and Future Challenges;A Digital Twin is a digital replica of a living or nonliving physical entity, and this emerging technology attracted extensive attention from different industries during the past decade. Although a few Digital Twin studies have been conducted in the transportation domain very recently, there is no systematic research with a holistic framework connecting various mobility entities together. In this study, a Mobility Digital Twin (MDT) framework is developed, which is defined as an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data-driven cloud-edge-device framework for mobility services. This MDT consists of three building blocks in the physical space (namely Human, Vehicle, and Traffic), and their associated Digital Twins in the digital space. An example cloud-edge architecture is built with AmazonWeb Services (AWS) to accommodate the proposed MDT framework and to fulfill its digital functionalities of storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction. The effectiveness of the MDT framework is shown through the case study of three digital building blocks with their key micro-services: the Human Digital Twin with user management and driver type classification, the Vehicle Digital Twin with cloud-based Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), and the Traffic Digital Twin with traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limit. Future challenges of the proposed MDT framework are discussed towards the end of the paper, including standardization, AI for computing, public or private cloud service, and network heterogeneity.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Internet of Things Journal;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125742081
10;Digital Twin-Assisted Cooperative Driving at Non-Signalized Intersections;Digital Twin, as an emerging technology related to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT), has attracted increasing attentions during the past decade. Conceptually, a Digital Twin is a digital replica of a physical entity in the real world, and this technology is leveraged in this study to design a cooperative driving system at non-signalized intersections, allowing connected vehicles to cooperate with each other to cross intersections without any full stops. Within the proposed Digital Twin framework, we developed an enhanced first-in-first-out (FIFO) slot reservation algorithm to schedule the sequence of crossing vehicles, a consensus motion control algorithm to calculate vehicles' referenced longitudinal motion, and a model-based motion estimation algorithm to tackle communication delay and packet loss. Additionally, an augmented reality (AR) human-machine-interface (HMI) is designed to provide the guidance to drivers to cooperate with other connected vehicles. Agent-based modeling and simulation of the proposed system is conducted in Unity game engine based on a real-world map in San Francisco, and the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation results prove the benefits of the proposed algorithms with 20% reduction in travel time and 23.7% reduction in energy consumption, respectively, when compared with traditional signalized intersections.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles;2022-06-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85112604285
11;Digital Twin in Aerospace Industry: A Gentle Introduction;Digital twin (DT), primarily a virtual replica of any conceivable physical entity, is a highly transformative technology with profound implications. Whether it be product development, design optimisation, performance improvement, or predictive maintenance, digital twins are changing the ways work is undertaken in various industries with multifarious business applications. Aerospace industry, including its manufacturing base, is one such keen adopter of digital twins with an unprecedented interest in their bespoke design, development, and implementation across wider operations and critical functions. This, however, comes with some misconceptions about the digital twin technology and lack of understanding with respect to its optimal implementation. For instance, equating a digital twin to an intelligent model while ignoring the essential components of data acquisition and visualisation, misleads the creators into building digital shadow or digital models, instead of the actual digital twin. This paper unfolds such intricacies of digital twin technology for the aerospace community in particular and others in general so as to remove the fallacies that affect their effective realisation for safety-critical systems. It comprises a comprehensive survey of digital twins and their constituent elements. Elaborating their characteristic state-of-the-art composition along with corresponding limitations, three dimensions of the future digital twins for the aerospace sector, termed as aero-Digital Twins (aero-DTs), are proposed as an outcome of this survey. These include the interactive, standardisation, and cognitive dimensions of digital twins, which if leveraged diligently could help the aero-DT research and development community quadruple the efficiency of existing and future aerospace systems as well as their associated processes.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Access;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122087744
12;Model-Driven Development of a Digital Twin for Injection Molding;Digital Twins (DTs) of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) enable the smart automation of production processes, collection of data, and can thus reduce manual efforts for supervising and controlling CPPSs. Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.;Springer;Book Series;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);2020-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85086228557
13;The Role of Digital Twins in Connected and Automated Vehicles;Digital twins found their genesis in the halls of NASA and the methods of product lifecycle management. Rapidly evolving trends around the proliferation of sensors, the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, and cyber-physical systems have spurred the growth of digital twins. This paper reviews digital twins and their use in connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Strictly speaking, digital twins must have communication between a physical system and its model, as opposed to similar methodologies that achieve indirect communication through iteration, or that substitute different parts of a system simulation with bits of hardware or software for testing. In practice, new methodologies for testing CAVs are sufficiently complex and difficult to apply simple labels. This is seen in our review of vehicular digital twins. Several gaps and challenges are apparent for the continued advancement of digital twin applications. We note some developing areas as traffic management centers, digital maps, onboard diagnostics, and logistics. Digital twins foster model reuse and encourage the use of multiple models at different scales of resolution. The role of digital twins will continue to grow as models become more tightly integrated to the physical systems they represent. This will drive such models towards uniqueness (matching a particular vehicle or road), adaptability (evolving with changing conditions and subject to wear and tear), and interpretability (conveying useful information to a human user). A maturing connected infrastructure and the development of smart cities will cause the number of new digital twin services to explode in a myriad of unforeseen ways.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85122580472
14;Exploring city digital twins as policy tools: A task-based approach to generating synthetic data on urban mobility;This article discusses the technology of city digital twins (CDTs) and its potential applications in the policymaking context. The article analyzes the history of the development of the concept of digital twins and how it is now being adopted on a city-scale. One of the most advanced projects in the field - Virtual Singapore - is discussed in detail to determine the scope of its potential domains of application and highlight challenges associated with it. Concerns related to data privacy, availability, and its applicability for predictive simulations are analyzed, and potential usage of synthetic data is proposed as a way to address these challenges. The authors argue that despite the abundance of urban data, the historical data are not always applicable for predictions about the events for which there does not exist any data, as well as discuss the potential privacy challenges of the usage of micro-level individual mobility data in CDTs. A task-based approach to urban mobility data generation is proposed in the last section of the article. This approach suggests that city authorities can establish services responsible for asking people to conduct certain activities in an urban environment in order to create data for possible policy interventions for which there does not exist useful historical data. This approach can help in addressing the challenges associated with the availability of data without raising privacy concerns, as the data generated through this approach will not represent any real individual in society.;Cambridge University Press;Journal;Data and Policy;2021-07-16;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128999673
15;Security and Privacy in Vehicular Digital Twin Networks: Challenges and Solutions;With the flourishing and advancement of autonomous vehicles, the vehicular digital twin (VDT) has become an emerging paradigm, consisting of inter-twin communication and intra-twin communication. VDT can effectively address the current shortcomings of the autonomous vehicle and provide enhanced and scalable services to the users. Nevertheless, strict security and privacy concerns arise, as VDT collects a wide range of privacy-sensitive information of the users in real-time and is exposed to an open network environment in both physical and virtual horizons. In this article, we investigate the security and privacy of VDT. We first describe the vehicular digital twin network architecture in detail and then investigate some VDT-related applications. After that, we discuss the security and privacy issues in VDT. Finally, we put forward several potential countermeasures and open research issues for VDT from the perspective of security and privacy. We expect this work will bring more attention to further investigation on security and privacy solutions for vehicular digital twin networks.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Wireless Communications;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85136090712
16;Driver Digital Twin for Online Prediction of Personalized Lane-Change Behavior;Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are supposed to share the road with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in a foreseeable future. Therefore, considering the mixed traffic environment is more pragmatic, as the well-planned operation of CAVs may be interrupted by HDVs. In the circumstance that human behaviors have significant impacts, CAVs need to understand HDV behaviors to make safe actions. In this study, we develop a driver digital twin (DDT) for the online prediction of personalized lane-change behavior, allowing CAVs to predict surrounding vehicles' behaviors with the help of the digital twin technology. DDT is deployed on a vehicle-edge-cloud architecture, where the cloud server models the driver behavior for each HDV based on the historical naturalistic driving data, while the edge server processes the real-time data from each driver with his/her digital twin on the cloud to predict the personalized lane-change maneuver. The proposed system is first evaluated on a human-in-the-loop co-simulation platform, and then in a field implementation with three passenger vehicles driving along an on/off ramp segment connecting to the edge server and cloud through the 4G/LTE cellular network. The lane-change intention can be recognized in 6 s on average before the vehicle crosses the lane separation line, and the Mean Euclidean Distance between the predicted trajectory and GPS ground truth is 1.03 m within a 4-s prediction window. Compared to the general model, using a personalized model can improve prediction accuracy by 27.8%.

17;Interaction with Industrial Digital Twin Using Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning;Digital twins have revolutionized manufacturing and maintenance, allowing us to interact with virtual yet realistic representations of the physical world in simulations to identify potential problems or opportunities for improvement. However, traditional digital twins do not have the ability to communicate with humans using natural language, which limits their potential usefulness. Although conventional natural language processing methods have proven to be effective in solving certain tasks, neuro-symbolic AI offers a new approach that leads to more robust and versatile solutions. In this paper, we propose neuro-symbolic reasoning (NSR)—a fundamental method for interacting with 3D digital twins using natural language. The method understands user requests and contexts to manipulate 3D components of digital twins and is able to read maintenance manuals and implement installations and removal procedures autonomously. A practical neuro-symbolic dataset of machine-understandable manuals, 3D models, and user queries is collected to train the neuro-symbolic reasoning interaction mechanism. The evaluation demonstrates that NSR can execute user commands accurately, achieving 96.2% accuracy on test data. The proposed method has industrial importance since it provides the technology to perform maintenance procedures, request information from manuals, and serve as a tool to interact with complex virtual machinery using natural language.;MDPI;Journal;Sensors;2023-02-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147895020
18;Urban Digital Twin Challenges: A Systematic Review and Perspectives for Sustainable Smart Cities;"Recent scientific and technological advancements have transformed the knowledge frontiers, giving rise to the next wave of disruptive technologies with deep impacts on urban society. An Urban Digital Twin (UDT) is a technology with great potential to transform the management and planning of the infrastructures and systems of sustainable smart cities towards environmental sustainability. However, despite the recent increase of research on UDTs due to its widespread diffusion much more recently, there is a lack of studies examining the existing bottlenecks to its implementation. To fill this gap, this study provides a systematic literature review on the key challenges and open issues pertaining to the implementation of an UDT. Results indicate 8 important categories of challenges related to (1) interoperability and semantics; (2) infrastructure, including storage, computation, network; (3) data acquisition and actuation; (4) data quality and harmonization; (5) modeling, simulation and decision-support; (6) data visualization and information display; (7) human and capital resources; and finally (8) governance, organizational and social issues. All topics are significantly raised in the literature, with most emphasis on issues pertaining to data and model semantics, missing data, data quality and modeling. The findings serve to inform practitioners about the bottlenecks delaying the implementation of UDTs.";Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Sustainable Cities and Society;2023-12-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163715089
19;XPlaM: A toolkit for automating the acquisition of BDI agent-based Digital Twins of organizations;A Digital Twin ideally manifests the same behaviour (in silico) of its physical counterpart. While considerable attention has been paid to the development of Digital Twins for physical devices/systems, the question of developing Twins for organizations has received relatively little attention. The setting in which we address this problem is very general and, consequently, very challenging. We look at the automatic acquisition of Digital Twins of organizations. To that end, this paper builds on the following two premises: (1) that Digital Twins of organizations can provide value, and (2) that Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents are a particularly effective means for representing Digital Twins. The overall approach is to leverage the externally observable behaviour of the target system and then generate candidate BDI agent programs that best explain (in the sense of formal abduction) the observed behaviour. The candidate agent programs are generated by searching through potentially large hypotheses spaces for possible plans, selection functions and beliefs. The resulting approach suggests that using abduction to generate Digital Twins of organizations in the form of BDI agents can be effective.;Elsevier B.V.;Journal;Computers in Industry;2023-02-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144815865
20;A fog computing framework for autonomous driving assist: Architecture, experiments, and challenges;Autonomous driving is expected to provide a range of far-reaching economic, environmental and safety benefits. I n t h is s t udy, we propose a fog computing based framework to assist autonomous driving. Our framework relies on overhead views from cameras and data streams from vehicle sensors to create a network of distributed digital twins, called an edge twin, on fog machines. The edge twin will be continuously updated with the locations of both autonomous and human-piloted vehicles on the road segments. The vehicle locations will be harvested from overhead cameras as well as location feeds from the vehicles themselves. Although the edge twin can make fair road space allocations from a global viewpoint, there is a communication cost (delay) in reaching it from the cameras and vehicular sensors. To address this, we introduce a machine learning forecaster as a part of the edge twin which is responsible for predicting the future location of vehicles. Lastly, we introduce a box algorithm that will use the forecasted values to create a hazard map for the road segment which would be used by the framework to suggest safe manoeuvres for the autonomous vehicles such as lane changes and accelerations. We present the complete fog computing framework for autonomous driving assist and evaluate key portions of the proposed framework using simulations based on a real-world dataset of vehicle position traces on a highway.;Center for Advanced Studies on Collaborative Research;Conference Proceeding;CASCON 2019 Proceedings - Conference of the Centre for Advanced Studies on Collaborative Research - Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering;2020-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85087384919
21;Vehicle system dynamics in digital twin studies in rail and road domains;A digital twin is aimed to be a virtual model designed to accurately replicate a physical system in the digital world. This is why digital twins have become quite popular in recent years in both rail and road domain applications, and some researchers and engineers have started considering the term as a buzz word that attracts increased interest in their research. In some cases, this leads to misunderstandings regarding the digital twin concept, especially if the discussion relates to digital twins built on physics-based models. This paper’s detailed review has been performed to address this issue considering the application of vehicle system dynamics theories as a basis for development of digital twins and the implementation process in digital twin studies. The results show that most works are focusing on digital twin developments at the ‘top level of the pyramid’ and more comprehensive research and investigation studies are needed in terms of the application of vehicle system dynamics in design and construction of digital twins. This paper adopts and summarises the possible directions for the development of a future framework in terms of disciplines relevant to vehicle system dynamics and presents a forecasting roadmap on future development strategies of digital twins.;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;Journal;Vehicle System Dynamics;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149827450
22;Digital twin real-time hybrid simulation platform for power system stability;This paper offers a comprehensive exploration of the application of digital twin technology for power system stability. Leveraging both physics-based and data-driven modeling techniques, we propose a novel digital twin framework that provides high fidelity simulations of power systems. Several case studies, including voltage stability assessment, dynamic stability analysis, predictive maintenance of power transformers, and renewable energy integration optimization, substantiate the efficacy of the framework under different real-world operating conditions. Our research conclusively indicates that the digital twin framework significantly enhances prediction accuracy, accelerates analysis speed, improves system reliability, and aids in efficient risk management in power systems. As a significant outcome, the framework has demonstrated its potential to revolutionize power system management and operations by facilitating predictive maintenance and efficient renewable energy integration. The paper concludes by emphasizing that strategic partnerships between academia and industry, robust cybersecurity measures, and the development of comprehensive standards and guidelines are key to unlocking the full potential of digital twin technology in power systems.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Case Studies in Thermal Engineering;2023-09-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164211855
23;A review study on digital twins with artificial intelligence and internet of things: concepts, opportunities, challenges, tools and future scope;Recently, Digital Twin (DT) has a growth revolution by increasing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and relative technologies as the Internet of Things (IoT).

24;Security Analysis of a Digital Twin Framework Using Probabilistic Model Checking;Digital Twins (DTs) have been gaining popularity in various applications, such as smart manufacturing, smart energy, smart mobility, and smart healthcare. In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and the connections between them. While the data is collected from a physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to understand these security risks and their implications. However, there is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the help of a detailed case study in the healthcare domain.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Access;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151332509
25;Real-Time Participatory Sensing-Driven Computational Framework toward Digital Twin City Modeling;"A concept of ""digital twin"" as a model to bridge between a real-world and a virtual twin has emerged in manufacturing and product management. In the context of civil and infrastructure domains, the term ""digital twin"" has been redefined as up-to-date digital representations of built environments. This paper proposes a real-time participatory sensing-driven computational framework to model the up-to-date state of built environments in a virtual environment. In the proposed framework, crowdsourced visual data are obtained from citizens' participation to automatically identify the up-to-date states of infrastructure that would negatively impact the community resilience in extreme weather conditions. Then, to update the associated built environment information, real-time participatory sensing data are processed by using deep learning algorithms. Finally, the identified geometric and geospatial information of infrastructure is fed into the virtual environment toward a digital twin city model. Case studies in the context of power distribution infrastructure systems were conducted in Houston, TX, and it was demonstrated that the proposed method robustly updates the up-to-date condition of infrastructure into the digital twin city model. The proposed approach for updating virtual models based on participatory sensing-based real-time information has a great potential to facilitate data-driven decision-making for urban planning and infrastructure management in a smart city digital twin.";American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE);Conference Proceeding;Construction Research Congress 2022: Computer Applications, Automation, and Data Analytics - Selected Papers from Construction Research Congress 2022;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85128979097
26;Unpredictability of digital twin for connected vehicles;Digital twin is an essential enabling technology for 6G connected vehicles. Through high-fidelity mobility simulation, digital twin is expected to make accurate prediction about the vehicle trajectory, and then support intelligent applications such as safety monitoring and self-driving for connected vehicles. However, it is observed that even if a digital twin model is perfectly derived, it might still fail to predict the trajectory due to tiny measurement noise or delay in the initial vehicle locations. This paper aims at investigating the sources of unpredictability of digital twin. Take the car-following behaviors in connected vehicles for case study. The theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the predictability of digital twin naturally depends on its system complexity. Once a system enters a complex pattern, its longterm states are unpredictable. Furthermore, our study discloses that the complexity is determined, on the one hand, by the intrinsic factors of the target physical system such as the driver's response sensitivity and delay, and on the other hand, by the crucial parameters of the digital twin system such as the sampling interval and twining latency.;Editorial Board of Journal on Communications;Journal;China Communications;2023-02-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85150071576
27;NEW CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DRIVING BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CONNECTED VEHICLES;In this paper, we address the problem of managing driving behaviours within the context of Connected Vehicles (CVs). In contrast with the existing related solutions, we are proposing a Cyber Physical System (CPS) architecture that ultimately enables the continuous acquisition and processing of driving data and then the assessment and classification of driving performance according to a welldefined set of driving states. The transitions between these states are decided based on current and previous driving records. In addition to their use for the generation of the appropriate feedback to the driver, the driving states could be used to identify relevant data to be shared with the CVs in the vicinity. They could also be used to recommend personalized trainings to the driver based on his/her driving performance.;Slovak Academy of Sciences;Journal;Computing and Informatics;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85131383782
28;Cognitive-Digital-Twin-Based Driving Assistance;Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been developed to enhance driving safety by issuing timely warnings to drivers. However, current ADAS do not take into account the driver's cognitive state when delivering warnings, which can result in false alarms and impact the driver's trust in the system. To address this issue, we propose a Cognitive-digital-twin-based Driving Assistance System (CDAS) that issues warnings tailored to the driver's perception of the driving environment and driving style. In this letter, we present a model of the driver's decision-making process that explicitly captures their perception of the driving environment, their utility evaluation of predicted future environments, and their driving style in terms of minimum acceptable risk. The cognitive digital twin of the driver is then created and updated by minimizing the discrepancy between the predicted and actual behaviors of the driver. With the cognitive digital twin, the CDAS warns the driver when there is a significant discrepancy between the predicted driving strategy based on partial observation and that based on full observation. This approach can more accurately identify risks that the driver is not aware of and provide warnings only when necessary. We conducted human and simulated experiments in a virtual driving environment, and our results demonstrate that our proposed CDAS has a similar perception of risky behaviors compared to humans. Furthermore, the digital twin learning framework can identify the driving styles of human participants and accurately predict their driving strategies. Additionally, our proposed cognitive driving assistance system provides fewer false warnings and avoids more collisions compared to state-of-the-art ADAS algorithms. Our research shows that incorporating the driver's cognitive state and driving style can enhance the effectiveness and safety of driving assistance systems.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters;2023-08-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165681558
29;Driver's Perception Model in Driving Assist;Vision is the primary way to perceive the environment during driving. However, due to its low spatial and temporal resolution, a driver may fail to perceive agents on the road, which may lead to collisions. Modern vehicles are equipped with sensors that can better perceive the driving environment, as well as ADAS to provide driving assist. However, ADAS does not consider the driver's perception, which may result in unnecessary warnings or actions against the driver's will. These false-positives may cause distractions and confusions in complex driving scenarios, which pose safety threat. In this project, we proposed a driving assist system which can reduce the number of unnecessary warnings by taking into account the driver's perception of the driving environment. The driver's perception model combines estimation of driving environment update and driver's observation. The driver's observation is obtained from gaze tracking and the driving environment update is estimated based on the last observation. In this paper, we formulated inference problem on the driver's perception, and developed a virtual driving simulator to evaluate the feasibility of the system.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings - Companion of the 2020 IEEE 20th International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability, and Security, QRS-C 2020;2020-12-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85099371665
30;Exploring advanced process equipment visualization as a step towards digital twins development in the chemical industry: A CFD-DNN approach;Several studies involving the implementation of artificial neural network (ANN) technology for process design, monitoring, and control are under active research. This new technology has shown great potential in advancing chemical processes through the development of digital twins and smart factories. In joining this race, the current study explores the capability of physics-based modeling (CFD) and artificial neural networks for advanced process data visualization. Here, 20 CFD simulations of a multi-tubular reactor equipped with a Zn-Fe-Cr catalyst for synthesizing butadiene were executed. The simulation result was extracted as 3-D data with XYZ coordinates and imported into a python-based DNN model for training and cross-validation. An accuracy of 99.2% was obtained from the ANN surrogate model. The trained model was used to predict 3D data in terms of the process temperature, concentration, etc. The 3D data was then imported into a Paraview® VTK for detailed virtualization. Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and radial distribution of the various process variables, such as concentration profiles and pressure contour, were effectively visualized. A graphic user interface was further developed using Python for real-time visualization of the equipment. This implementation is analogous to the digital twin and is employable for online system optimization, high accuracy, low computational cost, and seamlessly integrable 3D real-time visualization system design for efficient, quick, and easy plant decision-making.;Springer;Journal;Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145615523
31;Armored twins: Flexible privacy protection for digital twins through conditional proxy re-encryption and multi-party computation;Digital twins, i.e., up-to-date digital copies of a physical object maintained in the cloud, make it possible to conveniently review a physical object’s state, indirectly interact with the physical object, or perform computations on the object’s state and history – also in combination with data from other digital twins. The concept of digital twins has seen wide uptake in Internet of Things use cases, e.g., in manufacturing to monitor a product’s lifecycle, or precision medicine to provide personalized treatment. Besides these benefits, challenges arise, especially if the involved data producers, clouds and data consumers are not in the same trusted domain: Who owns and controls the data? Are the parties (e.g., cloud) sufficiently trusted to handle privacy-sensitive data? In this work, we propose ARMOREDTWINS, i.e., a system for digital twins that protects the confidentiality of digital twin data while providing flexible and fine-grained sharing by employing key-policy conditional proxy re-encryption to enable processing on subsets of the data. Alternatively, to support computation on very sensitive data, our system integrates secure multi-party computation, which does not reveal the data items to the individual nodes performing the computation. Benchmarks of our implementation highlight the system’s feasibility and practical performance.;SciTePress;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Security and Cryptography, SECRYPT 2021;2021-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85111859175
32;Enabling and supporting car-as-a-service by digital twin modeling and deployment;Smart City is one area of application for the Internet of Things (IoT) and it has been attracting attention from both academia and industry. Cities will be composed by autonomous parts that communicate and provide services to each other. For instance, cars (autonomous or not) may be seen as a service that transports people from one point to another. Interactions between users and these kinds of services will grow, making it necessary to have digitization of all these parts of the Smart City. The Digital Twin (DT) concept proposes that real-world assets have a virtual representation connecting the physical world with the cyber world. This allows to track the whole life-cycle of this object as well as perform simulations with current or previously stored data. In this context, this work proposes the use of Digital Twin for enabling and supporting car-as-a-service (CaaS). A case study has been developed to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin, highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE;2021-02-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85111062915
33;Three research priorities for just and sustainable urban systems: Now is the time to refocus;Now is the time to refocus efforts in urban research and design. A changing climate and extreme weather events are presenting unique challenges to urban systems around the world. These challenges illuminate the social barriers that accompany disruptive events such as resource inequities and injustices. In this perspective, we provide three research priorities for just and sustainable urban systems that help to address these matters. The three research priorities are: (1) social equity and justice, (2) circularity, and (3) digital twins. Conceptual context and future research directions are provided for each. For social equity and justice, the future directions are mandatory equity analysis and inclusionary practices, understanding and reconciling historical injustices, and intentional integration with diverse community stakeholders. For circularity applications, they are better metrics for integration, more robust evaluation frameworks, and dynamic modeling at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Future directions for digital twins include developing principles to reduce complexity, integrating model and system components, and reducing barriers to data access. These research priorities are core to meeting several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e., 1—No Poverty, 8—Decent Work and Economic Growth, 10—Reduced Inequalities, and 11—Sustainable Cities and Communities). Useful social and technical matters are discussed throughout, where we highlight the importance of prioritizing localized research efforts, provide guidance for community-engaged research and co-development practices, and explain how these priorities interact to align with the evolving field of industrial ecology.;John Wiley and Sons Inc;Journal;Journal of Industrial Ecology;2023-04-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146902284
34;Modeling and Calibrating Digital Twin of Automatic Garbage Collection System in Sejong City;In recent years, developing a digital twin for a complex system has been a key research effort in the modeling and simulation (M&S) community. This paper presents one of the digital twin systems for an urban garbage collection system, located in Sejong City, South Korea. This garbage collection system requires constant maintenance and management, and particularly, a rapid collection of distributed garbage is required for urban sanitation and the population's satisfaction. However, the current status-quo is following a routine garbage collection schedule, so the system management becomes rigid. Therefore, we develop a digital twin model to experiment with the garbage collection mechanism and speed to provide a simulator for further study on its operation. Our digital twin model is designed by following the DEVS formalism and calibrated by a large-scale of real-world datasets. This paper delivers the practice of designing, experimenting, and calibrating this urban system.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings of the 2023 Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference, ANNSIM 2023;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165464885
35;Enabling Network Digital Twin to improve QoS Performance in Communication Networks;Network Digital Twin is a model that emulates the behavior of a real communication network and is commonly used for prototyping, testing, and network optimization. Utilizing the inherent graph structure in the communication network, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling digital twins of small-scale network. However, they face the challenge of scaling up the GNN model to make predictions on large-scale networks. In this paper, we build a scalable network digital twin capable of predicting the per-path mean delay from traffic and routing configuration on larger topology networks. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions when modeled using different neural network architectures and combined through various ensemble methods. We explore the performance of GNN models implemented using traditional Artificial Neural Networks and the novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN) techniques. We study the performance of different ensemble weighing techniques such as Averaging, Grid Search, and a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based weighing technique. Through our experiments, we intend to understand the challenges and advantages of each architecture and ensemble technique in building a scalable network digital twin using GNN.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings - 2022 IEEE SmartWorld, Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing, Autonomous and Trusted Vehicles, Scalable Computing and Communications, Digital Twin, Privacy Computing, Metaverse, SmartWorld/UIC/ATC/ScalCom/DigitalTwin/PriComp/Metaverse 2022;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168128840
36;Mobility Digital Twin: Concept, Architecture, Case Study, and Future Challenges;A Digital Twin is a digital replica of a living or nonliving physical entity, and this emerging technology attracted extensive attention from different industries during the past decade. Although a few Digital Twin studies have been conducted in the transportation domain very recently, there is no systematic research with a holistic framework connecting various mobility entities together. In this study, a Mobility Digital Twin (MDT) framework is developed, which is defined as an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based data-driven cloud-edge-device framework for mobility services. This MDT consists of three building blocks in the physical space (namely Human, Vehicle, and Traffic), and their associated Digital Twins in the digital space. An example cloud-edge architecture is built with AmazonWeb Services (AWS) to accommodate the proposed MDT framework and to fulfill its digital functionalities of storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction. The effectiveness of the MDT framework is shown through the case study of three digital building blocks with their key micro-services: the Human Digital Twin with user management and driver type classification, the Vehicle Digital Twin with cloud-based Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), and the Traffic Digital Twin with traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limit. Future challenges of the proposed MDT framework are discussed towards the end of the paper, including standardization, AI for computing, public or private cloud service, and network heterogeneity.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Internet of Things Journal;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85125742081

38;Predictive maintenance using digital twins: A systematic literature review;Context: Predictive maintenance is a technique for creating a more sustainable, safe, and profitable industry. One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review. Objective: This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed. Results: This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry. Conclusion: This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models.;Elsevier B.V.;Journal;Information and Software Technology;2022-11-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85134599958
39;Advanced Technologies for Offering Situational Intelligence in Flood Warning and Response Systems: A Literature Review;Deaths and property damage from floods have increased drastically in the past two dec-ades due to various reasons such as increased populations, unplanned developments, and climate change. Such losses from floods can be reduced by issuing timely early warnings and through effective response mechanisms based on situational intelligence during emerging flood situations. This paper presents the outcome of a literature review that was conducted to identify the types and sources of the intelligence required for flood warning and response processes as well as the technology solutions that can be used for offering such intelligence. Twenty‐seven different types of intelligence are presented together with the technologies that can be used to extract such intelligence. Furthermore, a conceptual architecture that illustrates how relevant technology solutions can be used to extract intelligence at various stages of a flood cycle for decision‐making in issuing early warnings and planning responses is presented.;MDPI;Journal;Water (Switzerland);2022-07-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135622342
40;Scalability of Cyber-Physical Systems with Real and Virtual Robots in ROS 2;Nowadays, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are composed of more and more agents and the demand for designers to develop ever larger multi-agent systems is a fact. When the number of agents increases, several challenges related to control or communication problems arise due to the lack of scalability of existing solutions. It is important to develop tools that allow control strategies evaluation of large-scale systems. In this paper, it is considered that a CPS is a heterogeneous robot multi-agent system that cooperatively performs a formation task through a wireless network. The goal of this research is to evaluate the system’s performance when the number of agents increases. To this end, two different frameworks developed with the open-source tools Gazebo and Webots are used. These frameworks enable combining both real and virtual agents in a realistic scenario allowing scalability experiences. They also reduce the costs required when a significant number of robots operate in a real environment, as experiences can be conducted with a few real robots and a higher number of virtual robots by mimicking the real ones. Currently, the frameworks include several types of robots, such as the aerial robot Crazyflie 2.1 and differential mobile robots Khepera IV used in this work. To illustrate the usage and performance of the frameworks, an event-based control strategy for rigid formations varying the number of agents is analyzed. The agents should achieve a formation defined by a set of desired Euclidean distances to their neighbors. To compare the scalability of the system in the two different tools, the following metrics have been used: formation error, CPU usage percentage, and the ratio between the real time and the simulation time. The results show the feasibility of using Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 in distributed architectures for multi-agent systems in experiences with real and virtual robots regardless of the number of agents and their nature. However, the two tools under study present different behaviors when the number of virtual agents grows in some of the parameters, and such discrepancies are analyzed.;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);Journal;Sensors;2023-07-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85164846347
41;Model-Driven Edge Analytics: Practical Use Cases in Smart Manufacturing;In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, devices and systems generate enormous amounts of real-time data, and demand real-time analytics in an uninterrupted manner. The typical solution, a cloud-centred architecture providing an analytics service, cannot guarantee real-time responsiveness because of unpredictable workloads and network congestion. Recently, edge computing has been proposed as a solution to reduce latency in critical systems. For computation processing and analytics on edge, the challenges include handling the heterogeneity of devices and data, and achieving processing on the edge in order to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. In this paper, we show how low-code, model-driven approaches benefit a Digital Platform for Edge analytics. The first solution uses EdgeX, an IIoT framework for supporting heterogeneous architectures with the eKuiper rule-based engine. The engine schedules fully automatically tasks that retrieve data from the Edge, as the infrastructure near the data is generated, allowing us to create a continuous flow of information. The second solution uses FiWARE, an IIoT framework used in industry, using IoT agents to accomplish a pipeline for edge analytics. In our architecture, based on the DIME LC/NC Integrated Modelling Environment, both integrations of EdgeX/eKuyper and FiWARE happen by adding an External Native DSL to this Digital Platform. The DSL comprises a family of reusable Service-Independent Building blocks (SIBs), which are the essential modelling entities and (service) execution capabilities in the architecture’s modelling layer. They provide users with capabilities to connect, control and organise devices and components, and develop custom workflows in a simple drag and drop manner.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Book Series;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142698926
42;Digital Thread in Smart Manufacturing;The concept of digital twins has emerged from the smart manufacturing space and is now gaining adoption in many other industries beyond manufacturing. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a cyber-physical system that is used to capture the state of the system and to allow reason and decision-making on that state. While there has been much research on this topic, there is less work on the overall lifecycle ecosystem that supports the smooth interoperation of a physical facility (like a machine, a factory or even a supply chain) and its digital components (like data, processes and digital twins), which is called the Digital Thread. The aim of the Digital Thread is the creation of a digital lifecycle ecosystem that links together the data generated throughout a product’s lifecycle and represents the data, processes and communication platform that supports a product and its production at any instance of time.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Book Series;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85142686712
43;CensusIRL: Historical census data preparation with MDD support;Census returns are a critical source of information for governments globally. They underpin a wide spectrum of public planning including health, housing, work and education. Historically, census forms have captured names, places, dates, age, occupation, family structure, and religion. In more recent times, sexual orientation and ethnicity, queries that can be intrusive to vulnerable communities, have been added to the criteria, and for such reasons data security is of paramount importance. Most governments restrict access to individual census returns, presenting the data in aggregate report format. The Irish government is particularly strict, enforcing a statutory closure period of 100 years. An exception was made for the Irish 1911 census which were digitised and released for free online consultation in 2009 [1]. They are an excellent source for genealogists and historians alike but exist as separate digital siloes. This project uses an eXtreme Model-Driven Development (XMDD) environment to create linkages between both datasets. It will discuss the development process of the CensusIrl application and the process used in developing the matching algorithm used. We will discuss the census records and the data cleansing process used in creating the initial proof of concept application. We detail the different approaches to the development life-cycle of the application and describe the different utilises used in the sanitation of data points in the records and the match-making process.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2022;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147906466

45;Online validation of digital twins for manufacturing systems;Digital twins are considered among the most important technologies to optimize production systems and support decision making. To benefit from their functionalities, it is essential to guarantee a correct alignment between the physical system and the associated digital model, as well as to assess the validity of the digital model online. This operation should be conducted rapidly and with a small data set, especially in highly dynamic contexts. Further, the whole behaviour of a system may be of interest rather than the sole average performance. Traditional validation techniques are limited because of the restrictive assumptions and the need for large amounts of data. This work defines the problem of checking the validity of digital twins for production planning and control while the physical system is operating. A methodology describing the data and the types of validation is proposed including a set of techniques to be used at different levels of detail. The congruence between the physical system and the corresponding digital model is measured by treating data as sequences and measuring their similarity level with digitally-produced data by exploiting a proper comparison technique. The numerical experiments show the potential of the proposed approach and its applicability in realistic settings.;Elsevier B.V.;Journal;Computers in Industry;2023-09-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85163280370
46;Modeling and Synchronizing Digital Twin Environments;A digital twin is a virtual replica of a system defined at a certain level of fidelity and synchronized to a specific frequency. Digital twins are often used to replicate physical systems whose simulations are computationally expensive. If modeling the environment of any system is generally difficult, the problem is even harder in the case of digital twins, since the model of their environment must be synchronized with that of the physical system too. In this paper, we show how the environment of a digital twin can be effectively modeled and kept in sync with the real one, by adding digital proxies of the relevant elements of the environment to the models of the digital twin elements, and connecting them using the same synchronization mechanisms used by the twins. We demonstrate our approach with a case study of a smart room with sensors, using high-level software models.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings of the 2023 Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference, ANNSIM 2023;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165506827
47;Examining Model Qualities and Their Impact on Digital Twins;Digital Twins (DTs) are built using modelling and simulation techniques in complex domains such as cyberphysical systems. However, further formal investigation is required for how a DT and the services it provides relate to the qualities of the models used by a service. Specifically, this article examines when a DT service can be said to have the qualities of relevant, verifiable, substitutable, and faithful based on the results of checking properties in comparison to the actual system. Using an incubator system as our running example, we show how a DT service relies on multiple models, present the consequences when these qualities are violated, and discuss strategies for adapting models to ensure these qualities.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;Proceedings of the 2023 Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference, ANNSIM 2023;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165457165

Models are used as a reflective layer of the current state of the system to support the implementation of a feedback loop. More recently, models at runtime have also been identified as key for supporting the development of full-fledged digital twins. However, this use of models at runtime raises new challenges, such as the ability to seamlessly interact with the past, present, and future states of the system. In this paper, we propose a framework called DataTime to implement models at runtime which capture the state of the system according to the dimensions of both time and space, here modeled as a directed graph where both nodes and edges bear local states (i.e., values of properties of interest). DataTime offers a unifying interface to query the past, present, and future (predicted) states of the system. This unifying interface provides (i) an optimized structure of the time series that capture the past states of the system, possibly evolving over time, (ii) the ability to get the last available value provided by the system’s sensors, and (iii) a continuous micro-learning over graph edges of a predictive model to make it possible to query future states, either locally or more globally, thanks to a composition law. The framework has been developed and evaluated in the context of the Intelligent Public Transportation Systems of the city of Rennes (France). This experimentation has demonstrated how DataTime can be used for managing data from the past, the present, and the future and facilitate the development of digital twins.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Journal;Software and Systems Modeling;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85145994488
50;Impact of Digital Twins and Metaverse on Cities: History, Current Situation, and Application Perspectives;To promote the expansion and adoption of Digital Twins (DTs) in Smart Cities (SCs), a detailed review of the impact of DTs and digitalization on cities is made to assess the progression of cities and standardization of their management mode. Combined with the technical elements of DTs, the coupling effect of DTs technology and urban construction and the internal logic of DTs technology embedded in urban construction are discussed. Relevant literature covering the full range of DTs technologies and their applications is collected, evaluated, and collated, relevant studies are concatenated, and relevant accepted conclusions are summarized by modules. First, the historical process and construction content of a Digital City (DC) under modern demand are analyzed, and the main ideas of a DC design and construction are discussed in combination with the key technology of DTs. Then, the metaverse is the product of the combination of various technologies in different scenes. It is a key component to promote the integration of the real world and the digital world and can provide more advanced technical support in the construction of the DC. DTs urban technology architecture is composed of an infrastructure terminal information center terminal and application server end. Urban intelligent management is realized through physical urban data collection, transmission, processing, and digital urban visualization. The construction of DTs urban platform can improve the city’s perception and decision-making ability and bring a broader vision for future planning and progression. The interactive experience of the virtual world covered by the metaverse can effectively support and promote the integration of the virtual and real, and will also greatly promote the construction of SCs.

51;KSPMI: A Knowledge-based System for Predictive Maintenance in Industry 4.0;In the context of Industry 4.0, smart factories use advanced sensing and data analytic technologies to understand and monitor the manufacturing processes. To enhance production efficiency and reliability, statistical Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as machine learning and data mining are used to detect and predict potential anomalies within manufacturing processes. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of industrial data, sometimes the knowledge extracted from industrial data is presented in a complex structure. This brings the semantic gap issue which stands for the lack of interoperability among different manufacturing systems. Furthermore, as the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming more knowledge-intensive, uniform knowledge representation of physical resources and real-time reasoning capabilities for analytic tasks are needed to automate the decision-making processes for these systems. These requirements highlight the potential of using symbolic AI for predictive maintenance. To automate and facilitate predictive analytics in Industry 4.0, in this paper, we present a novel Knowledge-based System for Predictive Maintenance in Industry 4.0 (KSPMI). KSPMI is developed based on a novel hybrid approach that leverages both statistical and symbolic AI technologies. The hybrid approach involves using statistical AI technologies such as machine learning and chronicle mining (a special type of sequential pattern mining approach) to extract machine degradation models from industrial data. On the other hand, symbolic AI technologies, especially domain ontologies and logic rules, will use the extracted chronicle patterns to query and reason on system input data with rich domain and contextual knowledge. This hybrid approach uses Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules generated from chronicle patterns together with domain ontologies to perform ontology reasoning, which enables the automatic detection of machinery anomalies and the prediction of future events’ occurrence. KSPMI is evaluated and tested on both real-world and synthetic data sets.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2022-04-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85118864321
52;Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based Predictive Maintenance on parallel machines;In the context of Industry 4.0, companies understand the advantages of performing Predictive Maintenance (PdM). However, when moving towards PdM, several considerations must be carefully examined. First, they need to have a sufficient number of production machines and relative fault data to generate maintenance predictions. Second, they need to adopt the right maintenance approach, which, ideally, should self-adapt to the machinery, priorities of the organization, technician skills, but also to be able to deal with uncertainty. Reinforcement learning (RL) is envisioned as a key technique in this regard due to its inherent ability to learn by interacting through trials and errors, but very few RL-based maintenance frameworks have been proposed so far in the literature, or are limited in several respects. This paper proposes a new multi-agent approach that learns a maintenance policy performed by technicians, under the uncertainty of multiple machine failures. This approach comprises RL agents that partially observe the state of each machine to coordinate the decision-making in maintenance scheduling, resulting in the dynamic assignment of maintenance tasks to technicians (with different skills) over a set of machines. Experimental evaluation shows that our RL-based maintenance policy outperforms traditional maintenance policies (incl., corrective and preventive ones) in terms of failure prevention and downtime, improving by ≈75% the overall performance.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2022-12-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133894027
53;Hybrid learning-based digital twin for manufacturing process: Modeling framework and implementation;Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are powerful enablers for Industry 4.0 toward sustainable resilient manufacturing. Digital twins of machine tools and machining processes combine advanced digital techniques and production domain knowledge, facilitate the enhancement of agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems, and help machine tool builders achieve a paradigm shift from one-time products provision to on-going service delivery. However, the adaptability and accuracy of digital twins at the shopfloor level are restricted by heterogeneous data sources, modeling precision as well as uncertainties from dynamical industrial environments. This article proposes a novel modeling framework to address these inadequacies by in-depth integrating AI techniques and machine tool expertise using aggregated data along the product development process. A data processing procedure is constructed to contextualize metadata sources from the design, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages and link them into a digital thread. On this consistent data basis, a modeling pipeline is presented to incorporate production and machine tool prior knowledge into AI development pipeline, while considering the multi-fidelity nature of data sources in dynamic industrial circumstances. In terms of implementation, we first introduce our existing work for building digital twins of machine tool and manufacturing process. Within this infrastructure, we developed a hybrid learning-based digital twin for manufacturing process following proposed modeling framework and tested it in an external industrial project exemplarily for real-time workpiece quality monitoring. The result indicates that the proposed hybrid learning-based digital twin enables learning uncertainties of the interaction of machine tools and machining processes in real industrial environments, thus allows estimating and enhancing the modeling reliability, depending on the data quality and accessibility. Prospectively, it also contributes to the reparametrization of model parameters and to the adaptive process control.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2023-08-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148320496
54;Modular approach to kinematic reliability analysis of industrial robots;The robot kinematic reliability analysis methods based on parts or the whole machine have defects in accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, the paper proposes an efficient method to calculate and evaluate the kinematic reliability of industrial robots based on motion function modules (MFMs). Taking MFMs as the basic analysis units, the paper focuses on the influence of the uncertainty of intermediate MFMs on robot kinematic reliability. Based on the differential linearization error model and multivariate Gaussian distribution method, the transfer and accumulation of errors in the joint motion layer and the functional layer are described. And then, the summation method is proposed to calculate and evaluate the kinematic reliability of industrial robots. Through the error sum functions, the error variables are integrated into the appropriate motion module layer. It can effectively reduce the number of uncertain parameters in the kinematic reliability model, and then reduce the operation cost. In the case study, a TA6R robot is taken as an example to verify the accuracy and practicability of the proposed method.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Reliability Engineering and System Safety;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85138468520
55;Structural performance prediction based on the digital twin model: A battery bracket example;Battery bracket for new energy commercial vehicles is subjected to variable loads and battery temperature changes both during the design road test phase and in-service operation. Therefore, their structural performance must be evaluated in real-time for reliability design and health monitoring. With the rapid development of industrial digitization, the digital twin has become an indispensable technology. This paper proposes a digital twin approach for predictive monitoring of the performance of mechanical structures. Taking the structural performance for the battery bracket of new energy commercial vehicles as an example, this paper builds a unit-level digital twin model—DTMAR. It comprises the numerical model, NN-RSR model, and hybrid machine learning model. The results reveal that the DTMAR model can efficiently and accurately calculate and predict the structural performance. This can not only provide constructive guidance for optimal design of the next generation product structure, but also aid in evaluating the structural reliability of the battery bracket of new energy commercial vehicles and improve their driving safety.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Reliability Engineering and System Safety;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139312312
56;A bio-inspired LIDA cognitive-based Digital Twin architecture for unmanned maintenance of machine tools;Affected by COVID-19, the maintenance process of machine tools is significantly hindered, while unmanned maintenance becomes an emerging trend in such background. So far, three challenges, namely, the dependence on maintenance experts, the dynamic maintenance environments, and unsynchronized interactions between physical and information sides, exist as the main obstacles in its widespread applications. In order to fill this gap, a bio-inspired LIDA cognitive-based Digital Twin architecture is proposed, so as to achieve unmanned maintenance of machine tools through a self-constructed, self-evaluated, and self-optimized manner. A three phases process in the architecture, including the physical phase, virtual phase, and service phase, is further introduced to support the cognitive cycle for unmanned maintenance of machine tools. An illustrative example is depicted in the unmanned fault diagnosis on the rolling bearing of a drilling platform, which validates the feasibility and advantages of the proposed architecture. As an explorative study, it is wished that this work provides useful insights for unmanned maintenance of machine tools in a dynamic production environment.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2023-04-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85146253579
57;A multi-agent and cloud-edge orchestration framework of digital twin for distributed production control;The demands for mass individualization and networked collaborative manufacturing are increasing, bringing significant challenges to effectively organizing idle distributed manufacturing resources. To improve production efficiency and applicability in the distributed manufacturing environment, this paper proposes a multi-agent and cloud-edge orchestration framework for production control. A multi-agent system is established both at the cloud and the edge to achieve the operation mechanism of cloud-edge orchestration. By leveraging Digital Twin (DT) technology and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), real-time status data of the distributed manufacturing resources are collected and processed to perform the decision-making and manufacturing execution by the corresponding agent with permission. Based on the generated data of distributed shop floors and factories, the cloud production line model is established to support the optimal configuration of the distributed idle manufacturing resources by applying a systematic evaluation method and digital twin technology, which reflects the actual manufacturing scenario of the whole production process. In addition, a rescheduling decision prediction model for distributed control adjustment on the cloud is developed, which is driven by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and attention mechanism. A self-adaptive strategy that makes the real-time exceptions results available on the cloud production line for holistic rescheduling decisions is brought to make the distributed manufacturing resources intelligent enough to address the influences of different degrees of exceptions at the edge. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework are verified through a design case.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2023-08-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147843969
58;Intelligent tool wear prediction based on Informer encoder and stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit;Tool wear prediction is critical to the safety of the machining environment and the reliability of machining quality. To achieve accurate prediction, we propose a novel deep learning-based model with the backbone of the Informer encoder and a stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (IE-SBiGRU) network. A long temporal feature sequence with abundant information is initially derived from multichannel sensor signals. Compared to convolutional and recurrent neural network based approaches, the proposed model realizes a global inceptive field of long input sequence without multi-layer stacks and parallel computing of long-range dependencies, respectively. In comparison with the Transformer encoder, the Informer encoder reduces the attention matrix sparsity of the global temporal features, and the dominant feature map is selected with increased computing efficiency. A stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit network (SBiGRU) is then employed to strengthen the local correlation of the halving cascading features sequence. Finally, the global max pooling (GMP) layer is used to substantially lower the fully connected layer's dimension, and the predicted tool wear values are generated. The PHM2010 benchmark dataset and local experimental dataset are used to demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed model. Ablation studies are also conducted to indicate the effectiveness of model modules and recommended hyperparameters.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2022-10-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129938697
59;Conceiving a Digital Twin for a Flexible Manufacturing System;Digitization and virtualization represent key factors in the era of Industry 4.0. Digital twins (DT) can certainly contribute to increasing the efficiency of various productive sectors as they can contribute to monitoring, managing, and improvement of a product or process throughout its life cycle. Although several works deal with DTs, there are gaps regarding the use of this technology when a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) is used. Existing work, for the most part, is concerned with simulating the progress of manufacturing without providing key production data in real-time. Still, most of the solutions presented in the literature are relatively expensive and may be difficult to implement in most companies, due to their complexity. In this work, the digital twin of an FMS is conceived. The specific module of an ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) system is used to digitize the physical entity. Production data is entered according to tryouts performed in the FMS. Sensors installed in the main components of the FMS, CNC (computer numerical control) lathe, robotic arm, and pallet conveyor send information in real-time to the digital entity. The results show that simulations using the digital twin present very satisfactory results compared to the physical entity. In time, information such as production rate, queue management, feedstock, equipment, and pallet status can be easily accessed by operators and managers at any time during the production process, confirming the MES (manufacture execution system) efficiency. The low-cost hardware and software used in this work showed its feasibility. The DT created represents the initial step towards designing a metaverse solution for the manufacturing unit in question, which should operate in the near future as a smart and autonomous factory model.;MDPI;Journal;Applied Sciences (Switzerland);2022-10-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139958384
60;A hierarchical training-convolutional neural network with feature alignment for steel surface defect recognition;Steel is a basic material, and vision-based defect recognition is important for quality. Recently, deep learning, especially convolutional neural network (CNN), has become a research hotspot. However, steel defects have poor class separation, which is similar to the background, and different defects show similar textures. This causes some defects unrecognizable and influences production greatly. Thus, current CNNs still need to be improved. With this goal, this paper proposes a hierarchical training-CNN with feature alignment. The proposed method introduces a feature alignment, which maps the unrecognizable defects to the recognizable area, and a hierarchical training strategy is used to integrate the feature alignment into the training process. With these improvements, the proposed method achieves improved performance. The recognition results on a public dataset achieve 100%, which outperforms the other CNNs. And it has been developed into a real-world case successfully, which is significantly improved.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2023-06-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143615357
61;A novel health prognosis method for system based on improved degenerated Hidden Markov model;Health prognosis for power system is considered as a crucial process of condition-based maintenance. In order to solve the problem of large deviation between Hidden Markov Model and actual system health diagnosis, this paper developed an improved Degenerated Hidden Markov Model (DGHMM) with a core of the quasi power relation. First, the model adopts the degradation factors described the process of recession for equipment continuous decreasing in performance. Compared with the conventional exponential accelerated degradation, the quasi power relation accelerated degradation can better describe the process that the performance of the system decreases gradually with the increase of service age. Then, the improved genetic algorithm can replace the conventional EM algorithm for parameters estimation, which overcomes the limitation that the EM algorithm is easy to fall into local optimization. At the same time, in terms of the limitation of life prognosis problem as a result of the Hidden Markov Model must obey exponential distribution, an algorithm named greed approximation based on approximation algorithm and Viterbi algorithm can be proposed to seek maximum probability remaining observation for the purpose of seeking maximum probability dynamically surplus state path to predict the residual life of system. Finally, the proposed method is validated and evaluated with the data set of caterpillar hydraulic pumps. The results show that the method of system health diagnosis and life prognosis based on the improved degraded hidden Markov model is more effective in describing system degeneration and the accuracy of equipment state diagnosis, and is also feasible in the prediction of residual life.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing;2022-12-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133246372

63;A digital twin defined autonomous milling process towards the online optimal control of milling deformation for thin-walled parts;Thin-walled parts are widely used in the aerospace industry, where the milling deformation of the parts caused by their thin-walled draping and extremely large size ratio characteristics as well as high material removal rate has been the most common quality issue that greatly affects the assembly performance and operation safety of aerospace equipment. Hence, effective management of milling deformation for a thin-walled part will significantly improve its quality, which, however, is still made difficult by the lack of a real-time deformation perception, optimization, and control method. To bridge this gap, a novel online optimal control method of milling deformation for thin-walled parts is proposed by incorporating digital twins into the milling process of thin-walled parts. To this end, a reference framework of the milling process digital twin (MPDT) for thin-walled parts are designed, where the autonomous operation logic of MPDT for online optimal control of milling deformation is further clarified. On that basis, three key enabling technologies of MPDT are introduced from the perspective of multidimensional high-fidelity MPDT modeling, knowledge-driven low-latency milling deformation simulation, and online optimal control of milling deformation, which provide an insight into the industrial implementation of MPDT.

66;Digital twin-driven fatigue life prediction framework of mechanical structures using a power density theory: Application to off-road vehicle front axle housing;Accurate fatigue life prediction is beneficial for fatigue maintenance of complex mechanical structures of off-road vehicles. For fatigue life prediction of mechanical structures subjected to non-stationary random loads during operation, this paper proposes a digital twin-driven fatigue life prediction method for mechanical structures. The core consists of improved fatigue theory, stress online measurement, and fatigue damage verification. In this study, a digital twin (DT) prediction framework containing multiple correction factors is established, in which the actual stress values in the physical world and the stress predictions of the estimated twin model can be obtained in real time. The remaining strength degradation of the structure and material can be compared to correct the prediction accuracy of fatigue analysis. In addition, based on the power density theory, combined with the short-time Fourier transform, a fatigue life analysis method that can comprehensively calculate the effect of load amplitude and frequency on fatigue is proposed. A test case has been demonstrated using a front axle housing of the off-road vehicle. The difference between the results predicted by the method in this paper and the actual fatigue results in failure time is only 2.65 h, with a relative error of only 3.95 %.

68;Investigation of the microstructure and friction mechanism of novel CoCrCu0.2FeMo x high-entropy alloy coating using plasma arc cladding;To explore the effect of the Mo element on the microstructure and frictional properties of the coating, we prepared novel CoCrCu0.2FeMox (ie., x values in molar ratio, where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) high-entropy alloy coatings on the surface of 304 stainless steel substrate by using plasma arc cladding technology in this work. By using scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, microhardness tester and three-dimensional laser measurement microscope, we analyzed the effect of Mo element on the phase structure, microscopic morphology, microhardness and friction properties of the coatings. The friction mechanism of the coatings was carefully investigated. The experimental results show that the CoCrCu0.2FeMox high-entropy alloy coatings are composed of Face-Centered Cubic phase (FCC phase) and δ phase (rich Mo, Cr). The microscopic morphology of the alloy changes gradually from branch crystal to eutectic structure with the increase of Mo content. At the same time, the hardness of the coatings increased, while the wear volume, wear rate and average surface roughness decreased. When the Mo content is increased to 0.3, the delamination of the oxide layer is effectively reduced. The friction mechanism changed from abrasive wear, oxidation wear and fatigue spalling to abrasive wear.;Springer;Journal;Journal of Materials Science;2022-11-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85141347967
69;Prognostics and health management via long short-term digital twins;Current digital twin-based Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) research mainly focuses on prediction with a few parameters or a single event. However, when the relationship between moving parts of equipment is complex, both instantaneous failure and long-period degradation should be considered. Existing research is challenging to describe the dynamic evolution of the health status of the target object at varied time scales. In addition, data characteristics at different time scales are difficult to be captured simultaneously by current methods. This paper proposes an innovative dual time scale digital twin modeling and analysis method. According to the PHM business rules, the time series signals are decomposed into fine-grained scales and adaptively constructed into short time scale and long time scale digital twins. The generated events of different scales pay attention to the temporal characteristics and uncertainties, and interactive mapping of events at different scales is realized in cyberspace. Events at a short time scale focus on the real-time occurrence of anomalies, and long-term events track equipment degradation and trends. The interaction and collaboration between different time scale models are also discussed. Finally, the paper uses the state monitoring of large cranes in iron and steel enterprises to verify the proposed method. The results show that this modeling method can reduce the uncertainty and incompleteness of system monitoring in a complex system.

70;Modeling production disorder: Procedures for digital twins of flexibility-driven manufacturing systems;While the achievement of mix flexibility is a key driver of competitive advantage for a manufacturing organization, it also represents a source of disruption on the shop floor that may compromise managers' ability to diagnose problems, predict behavior, and make decisions adequately. Given this challenge, the digital twin emerges as a potential tool to reestablish managers’ operational visibility. Its architecture allows for a manufacturing system model to be continuously updated and for management support services to be promptly delivered. Although some studies explore the use of the digital twin to solve specific flexibility-related challenges, the literature lacks a normative and systematic approach to guide the application of this technological architecture in a comprehensive set of flexibility scenarios. To address this gap, based on the normative knowledge acquired from the literature and subject-matter experts, we present procedures to design, implement, and use the digital twin within organizations that suffer flexibility-driven disruptions. We demonstrate the application of these procedures through a case in a large automotive parts manufacturer. Results show that the procedures effectively operationalize a digital twin architecture aimed at contributing to the achievement of a flexible production strategy.;Elsevier B.V.;Journal;International Journal of Production Economics;2023-06-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151011335
71;A hybrid-driven probabilistic state space model for tool wear monitoring;Tool wear monitoring (TWM) is essential to improve product quality and maintain machining safety. Within recent years, numerous techniques have been developed for TWM, including data-driven methods and physics-based models. However, traditional data-driven methods are highly dependent on measured data. The physics-based models are difficult to model complex machining processes. To solve these problems, a hybrid-driven probabilistic state space model is proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of TWM. In this work, a sensitive feature extraction scheme is first constructed to eliminate interferences and redundancies for improving monitoring efficiency. Subsequently, the Gaussian process is innovatively developed to integrate the data mining and physical model from a probabilistic perspective. On this basis, the particle filter is then utilized to estimate the model parameters and estimate tool wear conditions. Finally, an adaptive wear state recognition method is further established for the predictive maintenance of cutting tools. The practical data obtained from milling experiments are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results show that the proposed hybrid-driven method effectively improves tool wear prediction accuracy to over 97.7%, while the constructed probabilistic model successfully evaluates the prediction results with over 95% confidence. Therefore, the developed methodology may provide a promising way for tool health management to improve economic efficiency and maintain machining safety.;Academic Press;Journal;Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing;2023-10-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166636913
72;Digital twin-driven fault diagnosis for CNC machine tool;Traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods require a massive amount of data to train diagnosis models. However, the complex and coupled structure of CNC machine tools makes it difficult to obtain enough usable data. Current data generation methods ignore actual operating conditions and have imbalance, which reduces the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To tackle these problems, this paper presents a digital twin-driven fault diagnosis method for CNC machine tools. Firstly, a digital twin model of a CNC machine tool is established and validated. Then, a twin model library is constructed to include multiple twin models under different fault status. A model data fusion method is presented, using the decision tree algorithm Classification and Regression Tree (CART) to train a model selector and actual sensor data as input to select the optimal model from the library and realize fault diagnosis with the model. Finally, taking the CNC machine tool spindle as an example, the stiffness deterioration of the spindle during operation is effectively diagnosed, which verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Journal;International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85136568506
73;Design and research of digital twin machine tool simulation and monitoring system;The numerical control machine tool is an important part of manufacturing. The speed and accuracy of the machine tool simulation and the monitoring of machine physical model movement, model collision, and operation health are the most common bottlenecks. The previous studies on these problems are discrete and poor in real time. In this paper, combined with the digital twin (DT) technology, a perception-monitor-feedback system architecture is constructed. Based on the improved Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi (GJK) distance algorithm, the collision information of tool and machine tool can be better detected during the simulation and monitoring of machine tool movement, and the more real workpiece shape can be displayed. Based on the model synchronous motion driven by the production perception data and its potential information extraction, the tool wear online monitoring is carried out. The tool wear online monitoring is performed based on the production perception data–driven model synchronous movement and extraction of its potential information. Finally, the usability and efficiency of the system are verified by an example of a typical shaft part processed by a numerical control machine tool.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Journal;International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;2023-02-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85133425671
74;A multi-level modelling and fidelity evaluation method of digital twins for creating smart production equipment in Industry 4.0;Rapid advances in new-generation information technologies have been the main driving force for the transformation of manufacturing enterprises in Industry 4.0. Digital twin (DT), as a key technology to promote intelligent manufacturing, has shown great potential for manufacturing enterprises to create an industrial intelligence-driven production equipment through in-depth integration of cyber-physical systems. However, the lack of a systematic effective DT modelling method with a supporting evaluation metric is the most important factor restricting the application of DT in manufacturing enterprises. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes a novel multi-level modelling and fidelity evaluation (MLM&FE) method of DT for creating smart production equipment in manufacturing enterprises, which could help enterprises establish an industrial intelligence-driven production environment to quickly respond to changes in the customised global market, thus greatly improving competitiveness of the enterprises. Specifically, this paper firstly designs a reference framework for DT-enhanced smart production equipment, on which an MLM&FE architecture is proposed. Then, key implementation methodologies and tools for MLM&FE are introduced from the perspective of data space modelling, virtual space modelling, knowledge space modelling, model integration and evaluation. Finally, the developed smart production equipment prototype demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of DT MLM&FE.;Taylor and Francis Ltd.;Journal;International Journal of Production Research;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85168090382
75;A Data Augmentation Boosted Dual Informer Framework for the Performance Degradation Prediction of Aero-Engines;The prediction of performance degradation for the aero-engine is crucial to its health management, but the handling of the dynamic spatiotemporal dependence between condition monitoring (CM) data of multiple sensors and the status of performance degradation is nontrivial. Most previous prediction models of performance degradation treat different health stages equally in the training process, although the data in the initial degradation stage are relatively sparse and more important for training a decent prediction model. To bridge this gap, we propose a data-augmentation-boosted dual Informer framework (named DARWIN) for predicting the performance degradation of aero-engines. First, we present a degradation time-series data augmentation model based on Informer to increase the amount of degradation data, making it possible to emphasize the importance of data in the initial degradation stage in the following prediction stage. Second, we design a padding strategy for the run-to-failure (RtF) data so as to preserve the integrity of the degradation context comprehensively. Third, we invoke another Informer model for predicting the performance degradation in which a generative decoder is implemented to get predictions in one forward process instead of the recursive manner for fast computation speed and avoid error accumulation. On the benchmark C-MAPSS datasets, DARWIN yields a 27% accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art method, Informer, in the performance degradation prediction of aero-engines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of DARWIN on a fleet of eight turbofan engines under real flight conditions, thereby confirming its applicability.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Sensors Journal;2023-06-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85159674579
76;A Graph-Based Model Reduction Method for Digital Twins;Digital twin technology is the talking point of academia and industry. When defining a digital twin, new modeling paradigms and computational methods are needed. Developments in the Internet of Things and advanced simulation and modeling techniques have provided new strategies for building complex digital twins. The digital twin is a virtual entity representation of the physical entity, such as a product or a process. This virtual entity is a collection of computationally complex knowledge models that embeds all the information of the physical world. To that end, this article proposes a graph-based representation of the virtual entity. This graph-based representation provides a method to visualize the parameter and their interactions across different modeling domains. However, the virtual entity graph becomes inherently complex with multiple parameters for a complex multidimensional physical system. This research contributes to the body of knowledge with a novel graph-based model reduction method that simplifies the virtual entity analysis. The graph-based model reduction method uses graph structure preserving algorithms and Dempster–Shaffer Theory to provide the importance of the parameters in the virtual entity. The graph-based model reduction method is validated by benchmarking it against the random forest regressor method. The method is tested on a turbo compressor case study. In the future, a method such as graph-based model reduction needs to be integrated with digital twin frameworks to provide digital services by the twin efficiently.;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);Journal;Machines;2023-07-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85166206936
77;Leakage Fault Diagnosis of Two Parallel Cylinders in Pneumatic System with a Minimal Number of Sensors;The low investment cost is one of the core competitiveness advantages of pneumatic power systems. With increasingly pressing intelligent manufacturing, it is meaningful to investigate the feasibility of implementing fault diagnoses of pneumatic systems with a minimal number of low-cost sensors. In this study, a typical pneumatic circuit with two parallel-installed cylinders is taken as an example. The pressure, flow rate, and exergy data collected from upstream sensors are used for diagnosing the leakage faults in two downstream cylinders with the help of different machine learning methods. The features of data are extracted with stacked auto-encoders. Gaussian process classifier, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor are used for classifying faults. The results show that it is feasible to detect and diagnose downstream multi-faults with one or two upstream sensors. In terms of the working conditions presented in this study, the average accuracy of diagnosis with exergy data is the highest, followed by flow-rate data and pressure data. The support vector machine performs the best among the three machine learning methods.;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI);Journal;Electronics (Switzerland);2023-08-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85167776996
78;Digital Twin Modelling Method of Five-Axis Machine Tool for Predicting Continuous Trajectory Contour Error;The CNC machine tool is the passive executor of machining code. It cannot predict the machining accuracy during machining. If the error is found to be out of tolerance after processing, it will not only scrap the parts, but also greatly affect the processing efficiency. This phenomenon is very prominent when machining sculptured surface parts with five-axis machine tools. Therefore, this paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT) modeling method of five-axis machine tools for predicting Continuous Trajectory Contour Error (CTCE) caused by tracking errors and geometric errors. The DT consists of three parts: the Setpoints Trajectory (ST) model, the Actual Trajectory (AT) model considering tracking errors and geometric errors and the CTCE model. For a specific machine tool, according to the basic geometric information of the machine tool (tool length, kinematic chain information, etc.) and 41 geometric errors, the DT can be established. Inputting the Setpoints Positions (SPs) and the Linear Encoder Detection Positions (LEDPs), the DT can be used to predict the Tool-Tip Position Trajectory (TTPT) contour error and the Tool Orientation Trajectory (TOT) contour error. In order to verify the proposed method experimentally, the KMC400S U five-axis machine tool is selected to establish its DT by which the contour error of the S-shaped trajectory are predicted offline. Then, the DMU50 five-axis machine tool is selected to establish its DT to predict the contour error of the circular trajectory in real time. Combined with the deep motion mechanism, this paper proposes a DT modeling method for the vertical application scene of parts machining accuracy prediction, which is of great significance to developing the DT application theory and ensuring the machining accuracy of parts.;MDPI;Journal;Processes;2022-12-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85144875845
79;Joint dynamic dispatching and preventive maintenance for unrelated parallel machines with equipment health considerations;A decomposed dynamic dispatching and preventive maintenance (D-DDPM) framework is presented to overcome the computational challenges of solving large DDPM problems. Stochastic deterioration of machine health is explicitly considered. By efficient allocation of individual machines capacity under different machine health, the D-DDPM framework decomposes the global DDPM problems into single-machine DDPM problems while ensuring throughput optimality. Intelligent machine agents are then designed to solve the single-machine DDPM problems efficiently and to perform real-time decisions for individual machines. After the decomposition, the overall computational complexity grows only linearly with the number of machines and the proposed framework could be adopted in large systems. In the numerical study, the D-DDPM framework is near-optimal in small systems that have optimal DDPM solutions. In which, the computation time is reduced by 90.72% and the average cycle time is within 6% of optimal. For large systems without optimal DDPM solutions, numerical results show that the D-DDPM maintains throughput optimality and reduces average cycle time by up to 90% against other control policies.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85147304978
80;Prediction of Tool Remaining Useful Life Based on NHPP-WPHM;A tool remaining useful life prediction method based on a non-homogeneous Poisson process and Weibull proportional hazard model (WPHM) is proposed, taking into account the grinding repair of machine tools during operation. The intrinsic failure rate model is built according to the tool failure data. The WPHM is established by collecting vibration information during operation and introducing covariates to describe the failure rate of the tool operation. In combination with the tool grinding repair, the NHPP-WPHM under different repair times is established to describe the tool comprehensive failure rate. The failure threshold of the tool life is determined by the maximum availability, and the remaining tool life is predicted. Take the cylindrical turning tool of the CNC lathe as an example, the root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and determination coefficient (R2) are used as indicators. The proposed method is compared with the actual remaining useful life and the remaining useful life prediction model based on the WPHM to verify the effectiveness of the model.;MDPI;Journal;Mathematics;2023-04-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153928809
81;A kinematic precision reliability evaluation method for rotor-bearing systems considering multi-source wear degradations and random errors;Rotor-bearing systems play a vital role in machine tools, aero engines, and wind turbines. Generally, worn-induced degradation quantities and manufacturing errors of components are the main error sources that influence the precision reliability of rotor-bearing systems. The current precision reliability evaluation models are focusing on several error sources in only a few key components without agreeable results. Therefore, a precision reliability evaluation model is proposed considering all time-variant error sources and random error sources. Firstly, time-variant wear models for commonly occurred degradation types in a rotor-bearing system are developed. Secondly, the constructed time-variant wear models are inserted into the precision model with all moving components in the rotor-bearing system using meta-action structural decomposition method. Finally, the time-variant stochastic process discretization method is employed to establish the precision reliability evaluation model, and solve the precision reliability of the rotor-bearing systems. Case investigations are carried out to verify the performance of the present model, which provides a more accurate precision reliability evaluation model to estimate the conditions of rotor-bearing systems during the service period.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Journal;International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology;2023-02-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85130686757

86;A Cross-Domain Systematic Mapping Study on Software Engineering for Digital Twins;Digital Twins are currently investigated as the technological backbone for providing an enhanced understanding and management of existing systems as well as for designing new systems in various domains, e.g., ranging from single manufacturing components such as sensors to large-scale systems such as smart cities. Given the diverse application domains of Digital Twins, it is not surprising that the characterization of the term Digital Twin, as well as the needs for developing and operating Digital Twins are multi-faceted. Providing a better understanding what the commonalities and differences of Digital Twins in different contexts are, may allow to build reusable support for developing, running, and managing Digital Twins by providing dedicated concepts, techniques, and tool support. In this paper, we aim to uncover the nature of Digital Twins based on a systematic mapping study which is not limited to a particular application domain or technological space. We systematically retrieved a set of 1471 unique publications of which 356 were selected for further investigation. In particular, we analyzed the types of research and contributions made for Digital Twins, the expected properties Digital Twins have to fulfill, how Digital Twins are realized and operated, as well as how Digital Twins are finally evaluated. Based on this analysis, we also contribute a novel feature model for Digital Twins from a software engineering perspective as well as several observations to further guide future software engineering research in this area.;Elsevier Inc.;Journal;Journal of Systems and Software;2022-11-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135797712
87;Generating customized low-code development platforms for digital twins;A digital twin improves our use of a cyber–physical system and understanding of its emerging behavior. To this effect, a digital twin is to be developed and configured and potentially also operated by domain experts, who rarely have a professional software engineering background and for whom easy access and support, e.g., in form of low-code platforms are missing. In this paper, we report on an integrated method for the model-driven engineering of low-code development platforms for digital twins that enables domain experts to create and operate digital twins for cyber–physical systems using the most appropriate modeling languages. The foundation of this method is (1) a code generation infrastructure for information systems combined with (2) an extensible base architecture for self-adaptive digital twins and (3) reusable language components for their configuration. Using this method, software engineers first configure the information system with the required modeling languages to generate the low-code development platform for digital twins before domain experts leverage the generated platform to create digital twins. This two-step method facilitates creating tailored low-code development platforms as well as creating and operating customized digital twins for a variety of applications.;Elsevier Ltd;Journal;Journal of Computer Languages;2022-06-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129984615
88;Towards collaborative life cycle specification of digital twins in manufacturing value chains;A digital twin is a digital representation of an unique product or product service system that is sufficient to meet the requirements of a set of use cases. Following this definition, the implementation of a digital twin must be derived from concrete use cases along the life cycle of a product. However, the involvement of a variety of different stakeholders and frequent changes of ownership in the value chain complicate the identification of use cases as well as the specification of the digital twin and its governance. This leads to a need for a systematic approach that enables various partners to implement the digital twins needed for their specific use cases. This paper presents a specification technique that combines aspects from Model-Based Systems Engineering with Product Lifecycle Management to support a collaborative front-end planning and specification of digital twins. It integrates the different views of various digital twin stakeholders (product manager, systems engineer, developer, data scientist etc.) in a collaborative model across the value chain. As part of the systematic approach, a digital twin specification grid that structures guidelines for the aspects of a digital twin (e.g. the data sources) across the product life cycle is provided. The presented approach also supports the derivation of a digital twin by integrating different use cases. This specification technique is the first step towards a holistic, Model-Based Digital Twin Design Framework.;Elsevier B.V.;Conference Proceeding;Procedia CIRP;2021-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85102616373
89;A digital twin method for automated behavior analysis of large-scale distributed IoT Systems;The behavior of a large-scale distributed IoT system is often hard to verify and validate. The reasons include: 1) the specification is often unclear, ambiguous and incomplete resulting in misunderstandings and undesired behavior. 2) It is almost impossible for a human to reason about the correctness of a system consisting of thousands of components. 3) It is very hard to observe all related components when trying to solve a problem because the system is geographically distributed over large areas. A digital twin capturing the system operational behavior will be of great help to assist a human in detecting behavioral anomalies and reasoning about root-causes. This paper proposes a method to develop digital twins for automated behavior analysis of large-scale distributed IoT systems. We present a real-life use-case of a smart office lighting system for which the method was successfully applied. The developed digital twin was used for anomaly detection and reasoning in a semi-automated root-cause analysis (RCA) approach.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Conference Proceeding;2019 14th Annual Conference System of Systems Engineering, SoSE 2019;2019-05-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069795719

91;Experimentable Digital Twin for Virtual Validation of Manufacturing Systems;Global competition forces assembly, production, and logistic systems to be highly efficient and agile. Such complex systems deliver their functionality through dynamic interactions between their individual elements, which cannot be captured by analytical methods. To evaluate the impact of design decisions on system performance and validate a design alternative, it is necessary to use methods such as simulation that can replicate that dynamic behavior. The digital twin in industry 4.0 aims to replicate a system's characteristics and behavior. However, that has been mostly used for performance monitoring and control of a manufacturing system at the operation stage. This paper introduced an approach to develop an experimentable digital twin of a manufacturing system that can be used for virtual validation of a design alternative and analyzing the impact of design decisions on overall system performance as a function of dynamic interactions. The introduced approach constructs the system architecture of a manufacturing system by orchestrating systems engineering, object-oriented and finite state machine methods such that the developed Meta-model allows simulation of various alternatives and can be used later at the operation stage for smart manufacturing purposes. Therefore, the digital twin replicates the manufacturing system in its lifecycle from when it is a design concept to the stage that it is constructed physically.;Association for Computing Machinery;Conference Proceeding;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;2023-01-09;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85162884071

93;Smart manufacturing scheduling: A literature review;"Within the scheduling framework, the potential of digital twin (DT) technology, based on virtualisation and intelligent algorithms to simulate and optimise manufacturing, enables an interaction with processes and modifies their course of action in time synchrony in the event of disruptive events. This is a valuable capability for automating scheduling and confers it autonomy. Automatic and autonomous scheduling management can be encouraged by promoting the elimination of disruptions due to the appearance of defects, regardless of their origin. Hence the zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) management model oriented towards zero-disturbance and zero-disruption objectives has barely been studied. Both strategies combine the optimisation of production processes by implementing DTs and promoting ZDM objectives to facilitate the modelling of automatic and autonomous scheduling systems. In this context, this particular vision of the scheduling process is called smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS). The aim of this paper is to review the existing scientific literature on the scheduling problem that considers the DT technology approach and the ZDM model to achieve self-management and reduce or eliminate the need for human intervention. Specifically, 68 research articles were identified and analysed. The main results of this paper are to: (i) find methodological trends to approach SMS models, where three trends were identified; i.e. using DT technology and the ZDM model, utilising other enabling digital technologies and incorporating inherent SMS capabilities into scheduling; (ii) present the main SMS alignment axes of each methodological trend; (iii) provide a map to classify the literature that comes the closest to the SMS concept; (iv) discuss the main findings and research gaps identified by this study. Finally, managerial implications and opportunities for further research are identified.";Elsevier B.V.;Journal;Journal of Manufacturing Systems;2021-10-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85115371863

95;Digital twin-driven smart supply chain;Today’s supply chain is becoming complex and fragile. Hence, supply chain managers need to create and unlock the value of the smart supply chain. A smart supply chain requires connectivity, visibility, and agility, and it needs be integrated and intelligent. The digital twin (DT) concept satisfies these requirements. Therefore, we propose creating a DT-driven supply chain (DTSC) as an innovative and integrated solution for the smart supply chain. We provide background information to explain the DT concept and to demonstrate the method for building a DTSC by using the DT concept. We discuss three research opportunities in building a DTSC, including supply chain modeling, real-time supply chain optimization, and data usage in supply chain collaboration.

96;Toward smart manufacturing scheduling from an ontological approach of job-shop uncertainty sources;An integral application of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 in the job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) must contemplate the automation and autonomy of the involved decision-making processes as a goal, which is the main purpose of the smart manufacturing scheduling (SMS) paradigm. In a real production context, uncertainty acts as a barrier that hinders this goal being met and, therefore, any SMS model should integrate uncertainty generators in one way or another. This paper proposes an ontological framework that identifies and structures the entities shaping the joint domain formed by the job-shop scheduling process in its itinerary toward the SMS paradigm, the sources of uncertainty that it faces, and the interrelationship type that link these entities. This ontological framework will serve in future research as a conceptual basis to design new quantitative models that, from a holistic perspective, will address the stochasticity of manufacturing environments and incorporate the management of disturbances into the realtime resolution of automatic and autonomous job-shop scheduling.;Elsevier B.V.;Conference Proceeding;IFAC-PapersOnLine;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132207821
97;Multi-Agent Systems in Support of Digital Twins: A Survey;The joint use of technologies such as IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing or Virtualization has fostered the development of digital twins (DT). A DT is described as a physical entity, its virtual counterpart and the data connections between both. Digital twins are increasingly being used to enrich physical entities by exploiting different computational approaches, which are applied to the virtual twin part. One of such approaches is the multi-agent systems (MAS) paradigm. It is claimed they resemble DT in many features. In order to analyse the suitability of MAS for DT, this paper presents the results of a systematic literature review focused on the analysis of current proposals exploiting MAS to support the design of digital twins. We found that the integrating the multi-agent paradigm with digital twins can be challenging, because the distinction among them is sometimes blurry. Moreover, it has been detected that MAS are generally the interaction environment for the DTs, and data of the DTs allow agents’ better decisions to be made in real time. That is, the massive volume of data stored by the DT allows agents to make decisions based on these data, and on the other hand, MAS shapes the environment where the DTs operate and interact.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Book Series;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85132104555
98;Consensus of Uncertain Multi-Agent Systems under Granular Differentiability Concept;In this paper, the problem of consensus of linear multi-agent systems with both uncertain dynamics and uncertain switching topology is investigated. Uncertainties are considered as granular fuzzy numbers whicharerepresentedvia horizontalmembership functions (HMFs) and Relative Distance Measurement (RDM) arithmetic. It is first proved that there exists a crisp solution to a fuzzyLinear Matrix Inequality(LMI) problem. This proof creates a bridge such that multidimensional RDM arithmetic that has been devoted to linear functions so far could be entered into some problems with nonlinear functions. Then an algorithm is proposed for the consensus of the multi-agent systems with uncertainty. Here, by proving the existence of a crisp solution for fuzzy LMI, we are able to prove that the proposed algorithm can ensure achieving consensus. Furthermore, the gain coefficients obtained for this fuzzy system are crisp numbers and can be applied to real systems in practical applications. Finally, the final value of consensus is calculated as a fuzzy number to present a better understanding of the effect of uncertaintyon the final value of consensus. In addition, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is shown in a simulation example.;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.;Journal;IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85159692014
99;Integration of Hypermedia-Agents, Microservices and Digital Twin for Smart Agriculture;Digital Twin (DT) has been one of the rapidly emerging technologies in the past few years.

On the other hand, agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) are well established as a source of abstraction for intelligent engineering systems. Multi-Agent Microservices (MAMS) and Hypermedia MAS approaches are relatively new topics. This paper attempts to implement a Cognitive/Intelligent DT for Smart agriculture based on a combination of Hypermedia MAS/MAMS and semantic microservices. This work proposes a Digital Twin architecture and discusses realising this vision. A brief introduction of implementation is discussed in this paper. Moreover, it also concerns our future work on this.;CEUR-WS;Conference Proceeding;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85143984304
100;The Smart Supply Chain: A Conceptual Cyclic Framework;Purpose: The objective of this work is to analyze the characteristics of the smart supply chain (SSC) and to propose a conceptual framework research. Given the pace of current technological change, there is a need to analyze the new features of the SSC, related to digital technologies and the incorporation of services. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of the literature is addressed, analyzing the latest studies on the subject. This methodology allows to propose a conceptualization of the SSC and incorporate new elements of analysis. Findings: The results show that much of the innovation and instrumentalization of supply chains involves incorporating digital services to expand their functionalities, especially in terms of agility and connectivity. The servitization of supply chains is therefore a key new feature. Put in relation to other characteristics identified in the literature, a conceptual cyclic framework is proposed for the SSC. Originality/value: This study contributes to strengthening the theoretical foundations of SSCs and serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners.;OmniaScience;Journal;Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85159707455
101;Agents and Digital Twins for the engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems: opportunities, and challenges;Digital Twins (DTs) are emerging as a fundamental brick of engineering Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), but their notion is still mostly bound to specific business domains (e.g. manufacturing), goals (e.g. product design), or applications (e.g. the Internet of Things). As such, their value as general purpose engineering abstractions is yet to be fully revealed. In this paper, we relate DTs with agents and multiagent systems, as the latter are arguably the most rich abstractions available for the engineering of complex socio-technical and CPSs, and the former could both fill in some gaps in agent-oriented software engineering and benefit from an agent-oriented interpretation—in a cross-fertilisation journey.;Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH;Journal;Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence;2023-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85165304975
102;Industry 4.0 multiagent system-based knowledge representation through blockchain;In a world in which technology advances rapidly and culture is more and more related to technical instruments, customers are more aware of the production and personalization of their goods. Consumer gadgets now connect to the Internet of Things (IoT) in this period known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is the beginning of a digital revolution for business systems. Consumers expect individualized goods that are feasible only if the manufacturing unit is intelligent and scalable. An existing plant cannot be easily converted into a smart plant, thus designers and engineers need advanced solutions for which they can carry out practical pretesting without disrupting operations and output. One suggestion for accomplishing this is to use artificial intelligence (AI) via a multiagent systems (MAS) approach. MAS are used to model, based on independently configured instructions, the interdependencies of multiple manufacturing units. In this chapter, we review existing modes of development and control of activities and examine how MAS and blockchain technology can enable companies to increase knowledge and understanding in a competitive environment with unlimited resources in a common ecosystem.;Elsevier;Book;Artificial Intelligence and Industry 4.0;2022-01-01;https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85148841978
