Huangfu, YF; Dong, XJ; Cao, YX; Li, ZW; Peng, ZK; Sun, YT|A life-cycle dynamic wear degradation model of planetary gear systems|||WEAR|||An accurate prediction model for surface wear in planetary gear systems is essential to decipher wear fault mechanisms and facilitate model-driven failure prognosis. A high-fidelity dynamic wear model relies on the appropriate characterization and updating strategy of the tooth macro-geometry, contact parameters and dynamic load. A geometrically adaptive-loaded tooth contact analysis (GA-LTCA) method is proposed to bridge wear morphology and dynamic behaviours. The finite element method and run-to-failure test are adopted to verify the GA-LTCA method and wear prediction model, respectively. Based on the proposed wear model, the life-cycle wear characteristics and the updating strategy of wear geometry are investigated. Owing to the consideration of the micro-cycle of the contact stress and geometrical updating, the predicted wear profile exhibits a desirable agreement with experimental results. The tooth profile deviation vector should be updated more frequently than the finite element model of worn gears. Only the finite element grid of the sun-planet gear pair should be updated because the wear of the sun-planet is much more serious than that of the ring-planet. Numerical results indicate the potential of the proposed high-fidelity model for digital twin-based wear prediction and life cycle failure prognosis.||

BÃƒÂ¶se|A Low-Code Approach for Data View Extraction from Engineering Models with GraphQL|2023.0|IEEE|2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C)|https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350817|10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00139|Access to data for analysis and control tasks is at the heart of digitization efforts in the manufacturing industry. While sophisticated modeling languages like SysML describe systems and their components, data often ends up in purpose-built relational and time series databases. To generate value, information must be retrieved and integrated from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose an innovative method for leveraging SysML engineering models and database queries by combining them in a collaborative low-code web environment. First, we make heterogeneous databases available via GraphQL, a state-of-the-art approach for building Web APIs. Then, our web application enables domain experts to exploit containment relations in SysML models to connect diverse data sources. The outcome is an integrated GraphQL API that matches the engineering model structures by resembling views across multiple database sources. The discussed approach incorporates the benefits of data-oriented development and low-code platforms beyond the business automation domain.||
Bocciarelli, P; D'Ambrogio, A; Panetti, T|A Model Based Framework for IoT-Aware Business Process Management|2023.0||FUTURE INTERNET||10.3390/fi15020050|IoT-aware Business Processes (BPs) that exchange data with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, briefly referred to as IoT-aware BPs, are gaining momentum in the BPM field. Introducing IoT technologies from the early stages of the BP development process requires dealing with the complexity and heterogeneity of such technologies at design and analysis time. This paper analyzes widely used IoT frameworks and ontologies to introduce a BPMN extension that improves the expressiveness of relevant BP modeling notations and allows an appropriate representation of IoT devices from both an architectural and a behavioral perspective. In the BP management field, the use of simulation-based approaches is recognized as an effective technology for analyzing BPs. Simulation models need to be parameterized according to relevant properties of the process under study. Unfortunately, such parameters may change during the process operational life, thus making the simulation model invalid with respect to the actual process behavior. To ease the analysis of IoT-aware BPs, this paper introduces a model-driven method for the automated development of digital twins of actual business processes. The proposed method also exploits data retrieved by IoT sensors to automatically reconfigure the simulation model, to make the digital twin continuously coherent and compliant with its actual counterpart.||

Engineering digital twin solutions is a knowledge and effort intensive activity. In-depth knowledge of manufacturing plant, process operations, underlying physics, data, and technical problems is essential in the design of digital twin application for a given business objective. Industry domain experts, data scientists and solution developers must collaborate to build it with the required features and functionalities. Currently, it is not an easily scalable process. For each industry vertical and even for the same plant type, the development process has to be repeated manually. To address this, we present a model-driven knowledge-based approach where knowledge can be captured in a machine processible form and reasoned with, to systematically guide the solution development process. Knowledge is modelled at three levels of abstraction, namely, meta, plant type and plant instance. We describe how this helps in generalizing the knowledge, in driving the knowledge acquisition process, and in contextualizing knowledge to specific problem instances. We then outline how the captured knowledge can be exploited to guide various digital twin engineering tasks such as problem definition, model building (physics or data-driven), data preparation, algorithm selection, etc. In particular, we discuss how the approach helps in arriving at a detailed digital twin specification starting from a high-level business problem statement. We present a case study demonstrating the approach on a real-life industrial problem.  Ã‚Â© 2023 IEEE.||

In manufacturing, digital twins can optimize production, prevent failures, and save resources. To consolidate the different approaches to digital twins in manufacturing, ISO 23247 defines the essential functional elements of a digital twin. We present a model-driven digital twin exemplar that realizes part of this standard to analyze milling processes. Our digital twin reference architecture includes a digital twin service component that manages and connects different services to adapt the manufacturing process according to a given objective. Two digital twin services, for the adaptation of component and tool conditions and for geometric error adaptation, illustrate the potential of this reference architecture. The digital twin connects to an industrial milling machine via domain-specific languages. This exemplar uses models at design time and at runtime to separate the concerns of software engineers and domain experts and leverages these models to understand and optimize the use of industrial machine tools.||

Lehner|A Model-Driven Platform for Engineering Holistic Digital Twins|2023.0|IEEE|2023 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems Companion (MODELS-C)|https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350749|10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00045|With the combination of software and physical devices into so-called cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged to handle the resulting complexity and efficiently connect software to physical devices, the so-called physical twins (PTs). While DTs have gained more and more interest in both industry and academia in recent years, several vendors started to provide so-called DT platforms that offer software tools that promise to make it easier to develop and maintain DTs. When investigating these platforms in more detail, we found that they require the redundant specification of information that is usually already defined in engineering models describing the underlying PT. Additionally, they focus on connecting services to the running PT. Most DT applications however also need a connection to a simulation of the PT, which is currently not supported by the examined DT platforms. As different DT platforms usually each use their own proprietary language and software tooling, it is also currently time-demanding to integrate them with the software services that realize functionality based on these platforms. In the described thesis project, we propose an extended DT platform that solves the mentioned problems by leveraging Model-driven Engineering (MDE) techniques. More precisely, we (i) develop model transformations from existing engineering models to the proprietary DT models used by current DT platforms, (ii) create a DT megamodel that integrates DT models of existing platforms with models representing different endpoints such as PTs or simulations, and generic service descriptions, and (iii) propose a workflow model to define the interactions between different services and DTs, and a method that automates the integration of services and DTs into DT architectures based on this workflow model and the DT megamodel. We aim to evaluate our work by performing case studies on a set of CPSs. In these case studies, we measure the steps required for setting up and maintaining DT architectures for these CPSs, comparing our extended DT platform to existing DT platform support.||

To support the modelling of these complex systems, multi-paradigm modelling advocates explicitly modelling every part of a system at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction. From this perspective, this exemplar paper presents an exemplary application of multi-paradigm modelling on the multi-robot warehouse system to provide architectural, behavioural and operational models. These models demonstrate how multi-paradigm modelling has been applied to model the different system parts at different levels of abstraction, applying different modelling formalisms and notations. This paper aims to provide a reference repository of the collection of models of the multi-robot warehouse case study, which can be accessed and utilized to replicate this system, conduct more future research on this case study, and extend it using other formalisms and modelling approaches.||
Zhou, MK; Feng, DH|A New Modeling Approach for Power Grid Online Analysis|2020.0||IFAC PAPERSONLINE||10.1016/j.ifacol.2020.12.2503|A new modeling approach for power grid online analysis is proposed to support the realization of a new online analysis system architecture. The model-driven software development, automatic code generation, and in-memory computing techniques are employed in the modeling approach. Data source adapters are developed for the integration of the model with the existing EMS system. A large-scale power grid online network data model (similar to 40K-bus) is used for the model performance testing in a Lab environment. The proposed modeling approach was used to develop a new online analysis application, which was deployed and running in a provincial grid dispatching control center. The Lab and field performance measurement shows that the modeling approach-based application can achieve second-order end-to-end responsiveness. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.||
Xu, CY; Li, WY; Zhao, Y|A Novel Fused NARX-Driven Digital Twin Model for Aeroengine Gas Path Parameter Prediction|||IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS|||In this article, we propose a digital twin model (DTM) based on the nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous (NARX) inputs model network to predict engine gas path parameters accurately. The DTM is combined by a model-driven model (MDM) and a data-driven model (DDM). To allocate the function of MDM and DDM, a pretreating fusion method is proposed for the first time, which is divided into three parts. First, all parameters are predicted by the MDM. Second, for the parameters with bad predictive effects, the DDM is employed to optimize them. Third, the parameters with good predictive effects and those optimized by DDM are fused to generate the DTM. The DDM is built by a two-stage NARX. Particularly, a NARX with a gate recurrent unit attention mapping function is used to improve the accuracy of the predicted parameters. The experimental results show that the maximum prediction error of the DTM is less than 5%. This implies that the fused DTM guarantees the prediction accuracy of each gas path parameter in the case of performance degradation.||

The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle. Ã‚Â© 2020 ACM.||
Guo, JX; Zhao, DL; Gu, CX; Chen, X; Zhang, XL; Ju, MC|An enhanced state-aware model learning approach for security analysis in lightweight protocol implementations|||JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS|||Owing to the emergence and rapid advances of new-generation information and digitalization technologies, the concept of model-driven digital twin has received widespread attentions and is developing vigorously. Driven by data and simulators, the digital twin can create the virtual twins of physical objects to perform monitoring, simulation, prediction, optimization, and so on. Hence, the application of digital twin can increase efficiency and security of systems by providing reliable model and decision supports. In this paper, we propose a state-aware model learning method to simulate and analyze the lightweight protocol implementations in edge/cloud environments. We introduce the data flow of program execution and network interaction inputs/outputs (I/O) into the extended finite state machine (EFSM) to expand the modeling scope and insight. We aim to calibrate the states and construct an accurate state-machine model using a digital twin based layered approach to reasonably reflect the correlation of a device's external behavior and internal data. This, in turn, improves our ability to verify the logic and evaluate the security for protocol implementations. This method firstly involves instrumenting the target device to monitor variable activity during its execution. We then employ learning algorithms to produce multiple rounds of message queries. Both the I/O data corresponding to these query sequences and the state calibration information derived from filtered memory variables are obtained through the mapper and execution monitor, respectively. These two aspects of information are combined to dynamically and incrementally construct the protocol's state machine. We apply this method to develop SALearn and evaluate the effectiveness of SALearn on two lightweight protocol implementations. Our experimental results indicate that SALearn outperforms existing protocol model learning tools, achieving higher learning efficiency and uncovering more interesting states and security issues. In total, we identified two violation scenarios of rekey logic. These situations also reflect the differences in details between different implementations.||

Hu, D; Wang, HC; Yang, CL; Wang, BB; Yang, QR; Wang, YY|Construction and verification of dual-fuel engine combustion model|||JOURNAL OF THE ENERGY INSTITUTE|||In order to achieve real-time mapping and online optimization of the combustion process of a dual-fuel engine that is in prolonged operation, this paper is the first to combine the Wiebe function with a deep learning neural network to propose a zero-dimensional (0-D) combustion prediction model for a biodiesel-diesel dual-fuel engine. First, the parameters of the double Wiebe functions are calculated by the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA), and the operating parameters and Wiebe parameters are used as input and output parameters of neural networks, respectively, to construct parameter identification models. Then, the combustion process is simplified and reconstructed by combining the Wiebe function with the deep learning neural network, and a 0-D prediction model based on the hybrid model-driven and data-driven method is established, which can further obtain combustion results such as cylinder pressure curve and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). The results show that the coefficient of determination (R-2) value of the dual-fuel engine 0-D prediction model based on the double Wiebe function combined with POA-CNN-Bi-LSTM is 0.9827, and the model has good prediction accuracy and generalization. The development of the combustion model provides reliable numerical model support for the online evaluation and optimization of dual-fuel engine performance.||

This study presents a zero-dimensional (0-D) prediction model that integrates the advantages of model-driven and data-driven approaches. Initially, the snake optimization algorithm (SO) is employed to address the challenges related to low parameter fitting accuracy and multiple solutions in calculating Wiebe parameters. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (CNN-Bi-LSTM) is devised to establish a nonlinear correlation between operating parameters and Wiebe parameters. The structural parameters of CNN-Bi-LSTM are then optimized using the SO algorithm (SO-CNN-Bi-LSTM). Ultimately, a 0-D prediction combustion model is formulated by amalgamating the Wiebe function with the neural network, enabling real-time prediction of combustion results and generalization analysis of prediction performance under non-calibrated conditions. The findings demonstrate that the combustion model exhibits heightened accuracy, thereby establishing a robust technical foundation for the development of a digital twin in the engine combustion process.||

The optical mechanical surface of spaceborne telescope will deviate from the original design due to various objective factors during the whole link process, and the actual optical mechanical surface is not ideal. In order to ensure that it can work normally, it is necessary to simulate and analyze the stray light situation of the whole link.

First, a three-dimensional geometric model of the power transformer is built based on ANSYS Maxwell platform, including the iron core, windings, etc. Then, a digital model of the characteristic parameterization of the transformer in the digital space is established. The electromagnetic field and the temperature field based on ANSYS Workbench platform are coupled. Also, The temperature distribution of the air-immersed transformer core-winding module under six typical different working conditions is studied, and the hot spot location and temperature distribution rule under different working conditions are obtained. The simulation results of magnetic flux density, voltage and current under different operating conditions, losses and theoretical values show that the proposed DT model can effectively reflect the physical mechanism of the transformer. In addition, the simulated results show that the iron core temperature does not rise with the increase of the load rate and the winding temperature rises with the increase of the load rate.

To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%.

In the general framework presented in this work, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection. We specifically investigate the application of the proposed framework to a simple case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. The Bayesian model trained at the DT has the key advantage of capturing epistemic uncertainty regarding the communication system, e.g., regarding current traffic conditions, which arise from limited PT-to-DT data transfer. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.  Ã‚Â© 2023 IEEE.||

Currently, this process is highly reliant upon manual inputs, needing 10 times more labour hours than scanning the physical asset. The resulting modelling cost counteracts the expected benefits of the digital twin. We tackle this challenge using a novel model-driven method that exploits the highly regulated and standardised nature of railways. It starts by restricting the search for OLE elements relative to point clusters of the railway masts. The resulting point clusters of the OLE elements are then converged with various parametric models of different catenary configurations to verify the presence of OLE elements and to find the best possible fit. The method outputs a geometry-only digital twin of the OLE system in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The method was tested on an 18 km railway point cloud and achieves overall detection rates of 93.2% F1 score for OLE cables and 98.1% F1 score for other OLE elements. The accuracy of the generated model is evaluated using distance-based metrics between the ground truth model and the automated model. The average modelling distance is 3.82 cm Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for all 18 km data.

It is the concept of creating a virtual equivalent of a real-world object that exists parallelly in the real world. With the application of real-world data, a computer program can create a simulated model that can predict or understand the working of a product or a process that may not even be present in the physical world. In short, digital twinning is a digital equivalent of any real-world object, phenomenon, or utility. A digital twin is a model driven by the Internet of Things application and it can be employed to assess the current status of the object in concern and also to forecast its future condition, controlling the behavior and optimizing its performance. Digital Twins Technology has already found its applications in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, automobile, retailing, restaurant management, smart cities, etc. This paper brings a brief insight into this emerging technology, its importance, where it can be employed and its scope in the future.

Recently, many neural network methods are proposed to improve the tracking accuracy by constructing direct mapping relationships from noisy observations to target states. However, limited by the coverage of training data, those data-driven methods suffer other problems, such as weak generalization abilities and unstable tracking effects. In this paper, a digital twin system for maneuvering-Target tracking is built, and all kinds of simulated data are created with different motion-models. Based on those data, the features of noisy observations and their relationship to target states are found by two specially designed neural networks: one eliminates the observation noises and the other one predicts the target states according to the noise-limited observations. Combining the above two networks, the state prediction method is proposed to intelligently predict targets by understanding the information of motion-model hidden in noisy observations. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the state-of-The-Art model-driven and data-driven methods, the proposed method can correctly and timely predict the motion-models, increase the tracking generalization ability and reduce the tracking root-mean-squared-error by over 50% in most of maneuvering-Target tracking scenes.

AI-assisted energy saving is one of the potential self-organizing network use cases for radio access network intelli-gence that can be used to predict the service load. This prediction can in turn be leveraged for proactively turning OFF/ON the capacity booster small cells within the coverage of always ON macro cells. These ML workloads can reside in macro cell base stations as opposed to conventional cloud-centric architecture to meet beyond 5G ambitious requirements of ultra-low latency, highest reliability, and scalability. However, the power-hungry hyperparameter search of ML workloads distributed at edges of the radio access network is a major challenge that can have substantial effect on the overall energy -efficiency of the network. In this paper, we illustrate how coordinated efficient training of distributed edge- ML models driven energy saving functions can enhance network energy efficiency. We validate the proposed method through a data-driven simulation methodology augmenting real traffic traces and comparing it with variants of legacy edge-ML hyper-parameter search techniques.||

New concepts, such as Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Software-Defined Manufacturing, IoT, and rapid development of AI require the changes in the education of the future engineers, especially IT specialist responsible for the software part of industrial robots. This paper presents two connected robotics education factories aimed at teaching key concepts in robotics, artificial intelligence, human-robot interaction, Internet of Things (IoT), digital twins, model-driven software engineering, and risk analysis. The factories serve as an educational platform for students and professionals alike, enabling them to learn practical experience in designing, developing, and testing robotics software engineering methods in a safe and controlled environment. The factories are equipped with multiple sensors, actuators, and controllers that facilitate the integration of different technologies, enabling learners to work on scenarios that simulate real-world industrial processes. This paper introduces (i) seven educational goals that are crucial for modern and future robotic software engineers, (ii) architectures of the model factories and their components, and (iii) the underlying pedagogical approach, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of the factories to foster innovation and drive economic growth by equipping learners with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the digital economy.||

Despite this pressing need, existing structured methods for systematically assessing social, economic, and environmental impacts are not related to targets of the United Nations' sustainable development goals. Moreover, existing Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) lack concepts and tooling for sustainability assessment. Our aim is to allow modeling systems, their sustainability properties, and sustainability questions in a structured manner for a wide domain. This paper proposes the engineering and design of a domain-specific language for sustainability assessment embedded into ADLs and showcases its use for evaluating a citizen energy community system as a case study. We discuss possibilities on how to use such models in their further processing and explore challenges in technical realization. This initial step towards standardizing the sustainability assessments of modeled systems throughout the development is both comprehensive and formal so that developers can make informed, sustainable decisions based on consequence assessments upfront.||

In practice, this requires analyzing, preparing for adaptation, and adapting brownfield manufacturing systems. The digital twin, a digital representation of a manufacturing system, is a key enabler for efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability. Unfortunately, the analysis and preparation of brownfield systems for adaptation, as well as the creation of digital twins, are challenging and time-consuming tasks. This paper presents an approach to automatically create digital models of systems based on 3D CAD models. To this end, the CAD data, stored as a STEP file, is analyzed to extract relevant information for a subsequent graph analysis, which is used to identify components, their dependencies, and the resulting functional modules. Finally, the gained knowledge is transformed into feature models that can be used as a digital model for configuration selection to support automatic reconfiguration planning of brownfield manufacturing systems. The developed approach is evaluated based on an industrial use case of a soft gripper system.||

Those connections are essential to the complete system, as they enable external systems to react to changes in the internal model and vice versa. In our case, the model is based on Relational Reference Attribute Grammars, an extension of Attribute Grammars to enable conceptual models at runtime while retaining their benefits of modular specification and an incremental evaluation scheme. We present an approach to enable concise specification of the causal connection and needed transformations to match required formats or semantics. To show its applicability, a case study showing the coordination of multiple industrial robot arms using models is presented.

Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients' engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients' care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists' collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients' quality of life.||

This creates new demands on enterprises to meet stated goals in a dynamic and uncertain environment that translate to demands on the enterprise's software systems. Software systems however are currently designed to deliver a fixed set of goals and assumed to operate in a static environment, falling short in addressing the need for continuous adaptation under uncertainty. State-of-the-art adaptation architectures like MAPE-K have been applied to meeting non-functional requirements in a dynamic environment using a static repository of knowledge.

In this article, we present a novel approach to design and control smart manufacturing systems. The approach is reactive, that is responds to unplanned situations and implements an iterative refinement technique, that is, optimizes itself during runtime to better accommodate production goals. For realizing these advances, we present a model-driven methodology and we provide a prototypical implementation of such a production system. In particular, we employ Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as our artificial intelligence environment for automated planning of production processes and combine it with one of the most prominent Industry 4.0 standards for the fundamental production system model: IEC 62264. We show how to plan the assembly of small trucks from available components and how to assign specific production operations to available production resources, including robotic manipulators and transportation system shuttles. Results of the evaluation indicate that the presented approach is feasible and that it is able to significantly strengthen the flexibility of production systems during runtime. Note to PractitionersÃ¢Â€Â”Smart production is an umbrella for a number of shifts and initiatives that deal with digitization of manufacturing/production systems and related issues and potentials. In this work, we present an approach for utilizing automated planning for creating production plans. This is in contrast to the traditional approach, where recipes are programmed into the production system ahead-of-time. However, automated planning relies on specific languages and tools that are hard to master by nonexperts, which is a factor that strongly limited the utilization of plan-driven approaches for industrial automation in practice. Thus, we propose to generate planning tasks automatically with model-driven engineering techniques. We are utilizing the industrial standard IEC 62264 for the description of the production system, and the academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for planning. PDDL is handled completely transparent to the user, that is the user is shielded from its complexity by employing the IEC 62264 model as the sole frontend.||

To simplify network management, modeling techniques have been extensively applied to model network configurations and monitoring data. The most recent proposed solution in this context are OpenConfig models, which enable vendor-neutral automation. However, adopting networking models requires significant effort and cooperation from various stakeholders.The focus of this paper is to explore the challenges associated with adopting networking models, specifically OpenConfig models, from three primary viewpoints: network engineers, internet service/content providers, and networking software/hardware vendors. We also discuss possible solutions via application of software modeling techniques to aid in the successful adoption of networking models.||

Primary issues in this area stem from the absence of standardization and the complexity and heterogeneity inherent to the IoT landscape. Model-Driven Development (MDD) is considered an effective technique for IoT application development. We argue that there is a need for methodologies of MDD that encompass system development and integration, as well as organizational aspects. To compensate for this lack, this work introduces MIoTA (Modeling IoT Applications for Air Conditioning Facilities), a modeling method supporting IoT application development in the field of air conditioning facilities. The ADOxx-based MIoTA tool was developed in an industrial use case. It contains a Domain-Specific Modeling Language (DSML) and various functionalities to support the modeling and development processes, so no specific IT skills are required at the application level. The approach has been evaluated practically within the case study and with quality criteria in previous work. Ã‚Â© 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.||

There is thus a growing interest in adapting DevOps approaches coming from software systems to CPSs. However, CPSs are made not only of software but also of physical parts that need to be monitored at runtime. In this paper, we claim that Model-Driven Engineering can facilitate DevOps for CPSs by automatically connecting a CPS design model to its runtime monitoring, in the form of a digital twin.||
Sartaj, H; Ali, S; Yue, T; Moberg, K|Model-based digital twins of medicine dispensers for healthcare IoT applications|||SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE|||Healthcare applications with the Internet of Things (IoT) are often safety-critical, thus, require extensive testing. Such applications are often connected to smart medical devices from various vendors. System-level testing of such applications requires test infrastructures physically integrating medical devices, which is time and monetary-wise expensive. Moreover, applications continuously evolve, for example, introducing new devices and users and updating software. Nevertheless, a test infrastructure enabling testing with a few devices is insufficient for testing healthcare IoT systems, hence compromising their dependability. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach for the creation and operation of digital twins (DTs) of medicine dispensers as a replacement for physical devices to support the automated testing of IoT applications at scale. We evaluate our approach with an industrial IoT system with medicine dispensers in the context of Oslo City and its industrial partners, providing healthcare services to its residents. We study the fidelity of DTs in terms of their functional similarities with their physical counterparts: medicine dispensers. Results show that the DTs behave more than 92% similar to the physical medicine dispensers, providing a faithful replacement for the dispenser.||

This paper reports on bibliometric literature analysis of MBSE of IoT. It considers conference and journal publication trends in the state-of-the-art to identify emerging research themes from the standpoint of trans/multi-disciplinary scholarship and technology. We used ElsevierÃ¢Â€Â™s Scopus database to find relevant publications from January 2018 to December 2022. Using publication citation ranking and other factors (e.g., publication venues), we selected 110 articles and then analyzed them using BibExcel and VOSviewer software tools. With a modest decline in 2021, this analysis shows an overall increase in publications during the time period. A thematic analysis of the abstracts revealed a strong focus on the introduction of reference architectures and integration of MBSE with business and management methodologies like Agile and BPMN 2.0. Model-driven engineering and machine learning techniques are essential among the enablers for realization of complex heterogeneous IoT systems in the realm of Industry 4.0. We highlight these findings to better understand and meet the enduring challenge of scaling MBSE of IoT across diverse sectors like health, manufacturing, and transportation.||

Since there is no practical way to instantaneously measure it at run time, a model is required for its estimation. Recently, several data-driven SOH models have been proposed, whose accuracy heavily relies on the quality of the datasets used for their training. Since these datasets are obtained from measurements, they are limited in the variety of the charge/discharge profiles. To address this scarcity issue, we propose generating datasets by simulating a traditional battery model (e.g., a circuit-equivalent one). The primary advantage of this approach is the ability to use a simulatable battery model to evaluate a potentially infinite number of workload profiles for training the data-driven model. Furthermore, this general concept can be applied using any simulatable battery model, providing a fine spectrum of accuracy/complexity tradeoffs. Our results indicate that using simulated data achieves reasonable accuracy in SOH estimation, with a 7.2% error relative to the simulated model, in exchange for a 27X memory reduction and a approximate to 2000X speedup.||

The rising number of dynamically interconnected elements leads to an increasing complexity in such systems, which accompanies new challenges during systems engineering and thus leads to reaching the limits of contemporary methods. While the community has recognized this, new approaches recently arose to find solutions for particular parts of this problem. However, as the need for a holistic approach emerges, the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been standardized as a promising framework. While this domain-specific architecture framework is missing specifications to address all aspects of such critical infrastructure, this paper thus proposes a new modeling methodology promoting model-driven engineering (MDE) of current or future production systems based on the peculiarities of RAMI 4.0. To enable mutual architecture development across the entire system hierarchy and all stakeholders, the aspects of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) are considered. The proposed step-by-step guideline is thereby made applicable by a modeling framework called RAMI Toolbox that ensures the engineering of both greenfield and brownfield systems. Finally, the approach, including all artifacts, is evaluated based on a real-world case study proposed by Siemens.||

Such Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) produce large amounts of data, which can be used to analyze the systemÃ¢Â€Â™s state and optimize its operation. To enable this analysis, the respective software components need to be interoperable with the CPPSs. While standards, such as OPC UA, provide interoperability on a technical protocol level, we see a vastly heterogeneous landscape of data models. Therefore, the integration of analysis components with their underlying CPPS is usually a laborious, manual process, also discouraging reuse. To facilitate the reuse of analysis software in this setting, we propose a model-driven method for integration with the underlying CPPS and the consumers of analysis results. Our contribution consists of (i) domain-specific languages for semantically enriched interface descriptions and simple mappings, (ii) a code generator toolchain to realize the specified mappings, and (iii) a simple, loosely coupled architecture for the resulting system.||

A case study is presented here in which the proposed controller is applied to provide four main functions, including: 1- Control power at the microgrid point of common coupling, 2- Dispatch energy storage to minimize the cost of importing power, 3- Smooth the profile of aggregated power of renewable and energy storage, and 4- Devise load shedding strategy.||

Industrial SysPE state of practice is generally model-based. Due to the rapidly increasing complexity of systems, there is a need to develop and establish model-driven methods and techniques. To structure the field of SysPE, we identify (1) industrial challenges motivating the importance of SysPE, (2) scientific challenges that need to be addressed to establish model-driven SysPE, (3) important focus areas for SysPE and (4) best practices. We conducted a survey to collect feedback on our views. The responses were used to update and validate the identified challenges, focus areas, and best practices. The final result is presented in this paper. Interesting observations are that industry sees a need for better design-space exploration support, more than for additional performance modeling and analysis techniques. Also tools and integral methods for SysPE need attention. From the identified focus areas, scheduling and supervisory control is seen as lacking established best practices.||

As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development.||

UDTs model city aspects such as transportation, water supply or air pollution, together with their inherent complexity. For addressing this complexity, in this paper we propose the use of models distributed over the Cloud-to-Thing Continuum, in order to take advantage of the flexibility, scalability and computational capacity of digital services through the multiple physical infrastructures offered by this environment. Following this philosophy, we have modelled a distributed digital twin of the public bus service of the city of Malaga and the users who travel on it. We have validated the model against the real system using the USE tool, and used it to perform simulations and inferences. Ã‚Â© 20023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Firstly, the geometric model of the robot is constructed based on the physical space. Secondly, the constraints and physical characteristics of the robot's physical model are determined using the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) method. Then, the kinematic model is built based on the D-H parameters provided by the physical model to determine the behavioral model. Finally, an experimental platform is established with a virtual space update rate of 100 Hz, and trajectory verification is conducted, with relative position errors of 0.34%, 0.41%, and 0.22% for the X, Y, and Z axes respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of this method in digital twin systems.  Ã‚Â© 2023 IEEE.||

During the design process there exists an extraordinary amount of generated data resulting from created models, simulation, and engine field tests. This data can be leveraged by artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning to help accelerate the exploration of the large design spaces existing in the complex system of a gas engine. This paper presents a vision and road map of integrating such AIs and preliminary ideas on relevant AI models for such use cases. We explore increasing the realistic nature of existing simulations, approximating simulations to avoid excess computation, and cumulative effect modeling.||
Stennikov, V; Barakhtenko, E; Sokolov, D; Mayorov, G|Principles of Building Digital Twins to Design Integrated Energy Systems|2022.0||COMPUTATION||10.3390/computation10120222|The design of integrated energy systems (IESs) is a challenging task by reason of the highly complex configurations of these systems, the wide range of equipment used, and a diverse set of mathematical models and dedicated software employed to model it. The use of digital twins allows modeling in virtual space for various IES configurations. As a result, an optimal option of IES is obtained, which is implemented in the construction or expansion of a real-world IES. The paper proposes the principles of building digital twins for solving the IES design problems. The paper presents a new methodological approach developed by the authors to design an IES with the help of its digital twin. This approach includes the following components: the architecture of the software platform to create digital twins, a set of technologies and tools to implement the platform, methods to automatically construct a digital twin based on the Model-Driven Engineering concept, an algorithm to design an IES based on its digital twin, and principles to organize a computational process using a multi-agent approach. The results of the computational experiment using the software implementation of the IES digital twin components are presented for a test energy supply scheme.||

The miscellaneous IIoT sensors deployed for DSM are distributed and operate in a hierarchical and federated structure. Nonetheless, fulfilling essential quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as ensuring security and privacy (integrity) while maintaining scalability and interoperability (robustness), poses a profound challenge for the DSM cloud service platform. Although blockchain technologies have been used to safeguard integrity, the first two generations have imposed constraints on robustness. In contrast, the third-generation blockchain, a.k.a. decentralized crosschain ecosystem, complements Web 3.0 and metaverse and can mitigate the constraints of previous generations. Moreover, blockchain-based ad hoc solutions for DSM use cases are abundant; they often suffer from limited adaptability and unique or homogeneous use cases from a software engineering perspective. A holistic architectural modeling process (AMP) leading to a software reference architecture (SRA) is preferred when alleviating ad hoc constraints. Therefore, we proposed an AMP for SRA for crosschain-based DSM that safeguards integrity while preserving robustness. In the work described in this article, we have conducted the following systemÃ¢Â€Â”modeling process. First, we propose a novel software AMP for DSM. Second, we deduce a modeled SRA based on a crosschain. Third, we infer a modeled system architecture (SA). Empirical experiment results demonstrate that our proposed crosschain-based method outperforms the widely used on-chain-based method while achieving our objectives efficiently.||

These models are specified using dedicated, oftentimes graphical modeling languages. This includes general purpose languages such as SysML or UML which may be tailored to specific domains, and domain-specific languages with a much narrower scope. Either way, the specification of graphical modeling languages and the construction of MDE environments supporting these languages is centered on the definition of a meta-model. Meta-models capture the relevant domain abstractions and concepts by specifying the abstract syntax and static semantics of a graphical modeling language, while the concrete syntax definition, layouting principles and user interactions for model editing are only superficially addressed. This observation holds both for the current state-of-practice and the academic literature, and is at odds with the domain studied in this paper, namely the graphical modeling of real-world technical systems. Our practical observation and central hypothesis is that, in this domain, human factors should be primary concern for the design of domain-specific languages and environments, which enable domain experts to understand, create and edit their models much more efficiently and effectively. As basis for further discussion at the workshop, we report on our ongoing work to develop a technical approach and research methodology to validate this hypothesis in future empirical studies.||

A particular challenge in this context is insufficient guidance for operators on how to resolve issues and adapt their actions to a new production context. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) can help to identify and address likely causes of production quality issues. However, FMEA models are typically (i) isolated from engineering domain models on product, process and resource (PPR) concerns, and (ii) not actionable for operators. This paper introduces the FMEA-to-Operation (F2O) approach to reduce the risk of ramp-up delays and recurring quality issues by integrating the required domain knowledge for model-driven, machine skill-centric, and actionable process FMEA. The F2O approach (i) validates likely root causes of a production quality issue by linking these causes to engineering reality in a graph database, and (ii) derives operation checklists with prioritized countermeasures. In a feasibility study on a real-world welding cell for car parts, we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the F2O approach. Results indicate that the F2O approach is feasible and effective, and provides operators with actionable, context-specific guidelines that are well grounded in engineering models.||

This requires highly adaptive, versatile cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs), which react flexibly to changes and perform crucial adjustments. Self-adaptive digital twins (DTs) enable adaptability through monitoring the behavior of a CPPS, identifying problems, and determining adjustments for the optimization of processes. DTs work with an idealized representation of the CPPS. Changes in system behavior that negatively impact the process execution, e.g., caused by tool wear or variations of environmental influences, and, thus, the quality of the resulting product, are ignored. This ignorance leads to defective products, sub-optimal product quality, and hazardous CPPS states. To mitigate this, we present an approach to incorporate quality awareness into a model-driven reference architecture of a self-adaptive DT. The devised concept automatically analyzes and optimizes system behavior. To this end, a component for quality evaluation extends the reference architecture. The DT and CPPS are connected via OPC UA. To validate the approach, a fiber laser machine is utilized. The DT can operate both on a physical and a virtual laser machine. Ã‚Â© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are useful to urban areas in the Philippines through diversified applications: urban planning, disaster mitigation, environmental monitoring, and policy making. This study explored the use of free and open-source software to generate an LOD1 and LOD2 3D city model of Tanauan City, Batangas using building footprints from OpenStreetMap and elevation models from Taal Open LiDAR data. The proposed approach consists of GIS-based methods including data pre-processing, building height extraction, roof identification, building reconstruction, and visualization. The study adopted methods from previous studies for building detection and from Zheng et al. (2017) for LOD2 building reconstruction. For LOD1, a decision tree classifier was devised to determine the appropriate height for building extrusion. For LOD2, a model-driven approach using multipatch surfaces was utilized for building reconstruction. The workflow was able to reconstruct 70.66% LOD1 building models and 55.87% LOD2 building models with 44.37% overall accuracy. The RMSE and MAE between the extracted heights from the workflow and from manual digitization has an accuracy lower than 1Ã¢Â€Â‰m which was within the standards of CityGML. The processing time in test bench 1 and test bench 2 for LOD1 took 00:12:54.5 and 00:09:27.2 while LOD2 took 02:50:29.1 and 01:27:48.2, respectively. The results suggest that the efficient generation of LOD1 and LOD2 3D city models from open data can be achieved in the FOSS environment using less computationally intensive GIS-based algorithms.

The simulation methods are classified as model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid methods. In addition, simulation methods in these three industries are studied from the phases of design, manufacturing, and operation. The similarities, differences and characteristics of the simulation methods applied to the automotive, aviation and maritime industries are discussed and summarized from several aspects. Model-driven approaches are used more frequently than the other two methods in design and manufacturing phases, while hybrid methods have great potential to support different operations of DT-related studies in the reviewed three industries. In addition, issues of prognostics and health management (PHM) such as fault diagnosis, remaining useful life (RUL) has recently been more inclined to be studied using data-driven approaches. According to our analysis we believe that as DT technology evolves, the hybrid approach will become the mainstream strategy for DT-based modeling.||

However, the development of DTs pose significant challenges, particularly on the modeling and data management aspects. This paper presents a holistic approach to develop a DT implementation using a domain model derived from the standard SSN/SOSA ontologies. The proposed approach leverages the MERODE modeling method for rapid prototyping and validation, guaranteeing robust model quality checks and enabling the creation of flexible and reusable code adaptable to different architectural settings. Data management is enhanced through the use of the SOSA/SSN ontology, enabling semantic data models and inference strategies to achieve semantic interoperability. By combining MERODE and IoT ontologies, our approach aims to take a step forward in addressing the challenges linked to system complexity and data management in the development of DT. The proposed approach was validated by instantiating the proposed model with a real-life case.  Ã‚Â© 2023 IEEE.||

Closely related to this topic arises the concept of Digital Twin, which is a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes that connect to the physical counterpart to represent, simulate, or predict changes in the physical system. There are many works that focus on supporting the high-fidelity implementation of Digital Twins for specific physical devices. However, few of them consider the process as a real-world entity to be integrated into the Digital Twin. In this work, we present a microservice architecture to support the implementation of Digital Twins for IoT-Enhanced Business Processes, considering not only the physical devices but also the process itself and the relationship among them. This architectural solution is supported by a model-driven development approach, which proposes (1) the construction of a BPMN model to represent an IoT-enhanced Business Process and (2) the application of model transformation to automatically generate both Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) models and microservice Java code templates. DTDL models are used in the implementation of the Digital Twins for the IoT-Enhanced Business Process. Java code templates are used to facilitate the implementation of the microservices required to deploy the IoT-enhanced Business Process and its Digital Twins into the proposed architecture and maintain the digital and physical parts synchronised.

Firstly, the development status of smart grid digital twins was investigated and summarized from typical architectures, key technologies, and application directions. Then, based on modern information technology, we proposed the architecture and deployment method of the intelligent substation digital twin system. The proposed system consists of a data collection layer, a model driven layer, and a twin application layer, which respectively elaborate on the specific content and advantages, and supplement the complete deployment method of the system. The intelligent substation digital twin system effectively promotes the digitization and intelligence of substations, providing a new construction and management mode, and has potential application prospects in promoting equipment status perception, deterioration trend analysis, and fault handling in the power industry.||

However, it has been generating Big Data and seeking large computation cost because of the diversified sensors and processing requirements involved in heterogeneous robotics and their workflows. Therefore, cloud computing has become the incumbent platform for robotics. There are numerous works related to the architecture for cloud robotics. However, most cloud robotics architectures are ad hoc and are not based on a model. Inherent drawbacks of ad hoc approaches include being strictly domain specific and minimally customizable and adaptable. Moreover, heterogeneous cloud robotics platforms have been operating diverse requirements of industries and households. Nevertheless, there are certain benchmarks set to be achieved by Industry 4.0 and norms by Society 5.0. Those benchmarks and norms lead to new products and services in cross industries and alleviate the impending drawbacks. However, those should be achieved while retaining both the sovereignty and security of the respective systems and industries. This is equally applicable and an enormous challenge to the system-of-systems involving the cloud robotics domain. Therefore, we surveyed cloud robotics architectures. Then, we learned a top-down design approach involving a unified architectural framework as the cognitive approach for the highly variable and systematically complex challenges to be achieved in the next-generation cloud robotics domain. Reference architecture is a well-known approach for instantiating top-down unified architectural framework processes. Therefore, we proposed an architectural design process and modeling for the reference architecture for next-generation cloud robotics platforms.||

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) help them to bridge the conceptual gap between the problem and the solution domain. Engineering these languages is complex, as it requires comprehensive white-box knowledge of constituents of DSLs, i.e., syntax and semantics, and their composition and realization in respective technological spaces of language workbenches. For efficient language engineering reusing existing languages by composition is essential. For this purpose, various language composition and variability mechanisms have been developed. However, in the literature, there exists no approach enabling systematic language reuse holistically, i.e., including syntax and semantics, in a black-box fashion. We propose an approach for the systematic component-oriented reuse of DSLs (SCOLaR) that supports the integrated reuse of syntax, well-formedness rules, and semantics via black-box language components that are composable along their interface in a language family. We implemented a prototypical version of our solution with the MontiCore language workbench, that supports embedding and aggregation of grammar-based languages with translational semantics realized with code-generators. In the future, we plan to improve our implementation with the support of other language workbenches and to provide a comprehensive evaluation with a series of case studies. With our work, we aim to advance the field of software language engineering by providing a novel method for black-box language reuse capturing syntax and semantics definitions for textual external, translational DSLs. This paper outlines our approach by stating the problem, motivating our research question, and proposing our solution, our plan for evaluation, and presenting expected contributions.||

Zhu|The Cyber-Physical System of Machine Tool Monitoring: A Model-Driven Approach With Extended Kalman Filter Implementation|2023.0|IEEE|IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics|https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998107|10.1109/TII.2022.3231422|The condition monitoring is essential to the advanced manufacturing process in the era of the fourth industrial revolution because it ensures the prediction and optimization of machine tool conditions via data analytics or physical modeling methods. The cyber-physical system (CPS) has the property of intellectuality, scalability, adaptability, and openness, making it suitable for machine tool monitoring. The current data-driven CPS method is prone to interpretability and generalization limitations due to the empirical selection of hyper-parameters in the model and the need for heterogeneous data. On the other hand, traditional model-driven systems are difficult to adjust models to practical working conditions data due to empirical equations constructed by offline data. This article proposes a novel model-driven cyber-physical system (MDCPS) to overcome these weaknesses. First, the physical model generates a counterpart of the machining process to form a cyber world, and sensors depict the real-time state of the machining process to form a physical world. Second, for deep fusion between the cyber and physical worlds, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) approach is applied to calibrate the empirical model with online measured data. Third, the model-based diagnosis and prediction methods are used for online monitoring and control. Case studies of MDCPS for machining monitoring are presented to prove the feasibility of this model-driven system.||
Bariah, L; Debbah, M|The Interplay of AI and Digital Twin: Bridging the Gap between Data-Driven and Model-Driven Approaches|||IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS|||The evolution of network virtualization and native artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms have conceptualized the vision of future wireless networks as a comprehensive entity operating in whole over a digital platform with smart interaction with the physical domain, paving the way for the blooming of the Digital Twin (DT) concept. The recent interest in the DT networks is fueled by the emergence of novel wireless technologies and use-cases that exacerbate the level of complexity to orchestrate the network and to manage its resources. Driven by AI, the key principle of the DT is to create a virtual twin for the physical entities and network dynamics where the virtual twin will be leveraged to generate synthetic data and offer an on-demand platform for AI model training. Despite the common understanding that AI is the seed for DT, we anticipate that the DT and AI will be enablers for each other in a way that overcomes their limitations and complements each others' benefits. In this article, we dig into the fundamentals of DT, where we reveal the role of DT in unifying model- and data-driven approaches, and explore the opportunities offered by DT in order to achieve the optimistic vision of 6G networks. We further unfold the essential role of the theoretical underpinnings in unlocking further opportunities by AI, and hence, we unveil their pivotal impact on the realization of reliable, efficient, and low-latency DT.||

In this paper, we specify the characteristics of a paperless factory, the differentiation to a smart factory and propose a guideline for transitioning a document-based factory organization and control to a model-based one. The guideline is implemented in two teaching modules. These modules are the content of seminars, workshops, and consultation projects for the board of management, production supervisors, project leaders, and external consultants who are in charge of leading paper-based factories to partly or fully paperless factories.||

By raising the level of abstraction beyond code through visual programming and model-driven development, a Low-Code Development Platform (LCDP) provides the tools to create software using the low-code approach. LCDPs typically support specific application types and domains such as web applications, mobile applications, data analytics platforms and dashboards. While some LCDPs exist for control systems in the manufacturing industry, this domain is not yet fully supported. In this paper, we present a multiple-case study based on five interviews to explore the role LCDPs can play in industrial automation. In particular, we investigate which use cases are considered relevant for LCDPs and what the actual requirements for such platforms are from an industrial perspective. Our results show that many different manufacturing use cases could be implemented by or already benefit from LCDPs. However, successful future LCDPs must meet certain industry-specific requirements.||

In that way production process models are used as central artefacts to manage the production. In this paper, we propose a DSML which can be used to create production process models that are suitable for automatic generation of executable code. The generated code is used for automatic execution of production processes within a simulation or a shop floor.||

With modelling gaining traction for analysis-heavy use cases like decision-making and regulatory compliance where domain experts play a central role, this barrier is beginning to hurt even more. We posit that Generative AI techniques can significantly lower this barrier by enabling domain experts to construct purposive models by operating at natural language level. This requires domain experts to interact with Generative AI tools using the right purpose-specific contextual prompts. We propose a model-driven approach where purposive meta models guide the interactions between domain expert and Generative AI to generate such prompts. The proposed approach helps in overcoming some of the limitations of Generative AI such as missing local context, limited context window size, attention fading etc. Industry scale models are typically large, necessitating a team of experts to work in a coordinated manner which requires sharing of outputs and persistence across sessions. Our approach brings together MDE and Generative AI in a symbiotic relationship complimenting respective strengths and overcoming limitations. We have validated this approach for development of digital twin based applications and early results are encouraging.||
Paredis, R; Vangheluwe, H|Towards a Digital Z Framework Based on a Family of Architectures and a Virtual Knowledge Graph|||ACM/IEEE 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL DRIVEN ENGINEERING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS, MODELS 2022 COMPANION|||The purpose of systems engineering is to, often collaboratively and following complex workflows, analyse, design, optimize, operate, and evolve complex, cyber-physical systems. This paper proposes a vision of a general framework for the design, deployment and operation of Digital Z (where Z can be model, shadow, twin, passport, avatar...). Different Digital Zs are used, often in combination, for various purposes during systems engineering. That is why we propose a family of architectures for different Digital Zs. Each Digital Z architecture is constructed based on the engineers' goals. These goals can always be reduced to the observation, satisfaction, or optimization of some Properties of Interest (PoIs). Example PoIs are safety, and average energy consumption. We propose to have one Digital Z architecture per PoI. The different Digital Zs may be combined into an ecosystem. More variability is introduced when we zoom into the deployment of Digital Zs. Common choices for network communication such as DDS and MQTT each have their own strengths and weaknesses which must be taken into account when trying to satisfy non-functional properties such as meeting real-time deadlines. We also introduce the Modelverse, a Virtual (Federated) Knowledge Graph (VKG). It is used as a source of knowledge to aid in the construction of experiments which answer user's questions about PoIs. These, possibly concurrent, experiments are in essence particular Digital Z ecosystems/architectures. When the experiments provide answers, these are added to the VKG knowledge base in the form (question, experiment architecture, answer). The glue between the above is a template workflow. We sketch the above concepts by means of concrete examples and compare them with existing Digital Z definitions and frameworks such as the 5D model.||

However, most existing approaches lack support for the automated generation and setup of monitors and constraints for diverse technologies and do not provide adequate support for evolving the monitoring infrastructure. Without this support, constraints and monitors can become stale and become less effective in long-running, rapidly changing CPS. In this ""new and emerging results"" paper we propose a novel framework for model-integrated runtime monitoring. We combine model-driven techniques and runtime monitoring to automatically generate large parts of the monitoring framework and to reduce the maintenance effort necessary when parts of the monitored system change.

While specific benefits depend on the individual applications, speech interfaces typically increase accessibility, enable 'hands-free' and 'no-screen' interaction, and often increase interaction speed and allow for more flexible usage patterns and increased multitasking, leading to higher user satisfaction. This paper presents a method to transfer these powerful benefits to the digital twin (DT) domain by automatically generating speech interfaces for DT applications. Our approach is based on Model Driven Engineering principles, where we automatically deduce command patterns from structural model information as used in, e.g., DT platform specifications. The speech interface generation is highly configurable and extendable, thus it can be applied to different DT models. The concepts behind the generator are generic as well, thus they can be ported to other applications and platforms. We validate our approach by applying it to two DT demonstration cases and provide a detailed description of the sketch interface configuration workflow.  Ã‚Â© 2023 IEEE.||

The former is referred to as horizontal- and the latter as vertical interoperability. This paper proposes ways to improve interoperability using multi-level and multi-view modelling methods. Multi-level modelling maximizes the reuse of information at the high-level and reduces complexity at the same time by separation of concerns. Multi-view modelling also allows to reduce complexity by selecting a subset of model elements required by a stakeholder. Currently there is no effective modelling approach that can adequately combine both methods. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling approach that integrates multi-level and multi-view modelling to support the collaborative evolution of multi-level models by different stakeholders. We present the metamodel and a semi-formal definition of the approach and demonstrate its benefits in the context of a risk management case study from the energy industry.||
